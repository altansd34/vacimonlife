One of&nbsp;the bombshells he&nbsp;dropped was that he&nbsp;and his twin brother Dylan Sprouse were forced to&nbsp;pursue acting at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age to&nbsp;earn money for the family.

Despite these challenges, Cole and Dylan went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;achieve success in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><p><h2>However, their father wanted them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“normal kids.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/67e/590/b9b6b45db3875e074f796bd1ad.png><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;10, Cole and Dylan Sprouse were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>placed</a> in&nbsp;the custody of&nbsp;their father, as&nbsp;their parents had divorced when they were only one year old. According to&nbsp;Cole, by&nbsp;the time their father gained custody, they had already lost much of&nbsp;what they had earned during their earlier years in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><p>“My&nbsp;parents did not come from much, and&nbsp;I have now been granted a&nbsp;life&nbsp;of, primarily, financial stability&nbsp;— and surplus in&nbsp;very many cases&nbsp;— that is&nbsp;the byproduct of&nbsp;working for 30&nbsp;years and trading my&nbsp;childhood,” Cole <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p>The actor also <a href=#>shared</a> that their father had hoped to&nbsp;provide them with a&nbsp;more normal upbringing, wanting them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“normal kids.”</p><p><h2>Acting was never Cole’s passion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/49f/bfa/ab10f05660a5ad035099bdc020.jpg><p>Despite his successful career, <a href=#>Cole Sprouse</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that he&nbsp;had never made the choice to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor consciously: “I&nbsp;never made the decision to&nbsp;join the arts or&nbsp;acting specifically. And so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was never really my&nbsp;passion.” He&nbsp;explained that his entry into the entertainment industry was more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;means to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end during a&nbsp;custody battle.</p><p>As&nbsp;he&nbsp;and his brother Dylan Sprouse were successful on&nbsp;Disney Channel’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Suite Life of&nbsp;Zack and Cody</i></a>, Cole <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realized</a> that their careers had become the source of&nbsp;stability and routine that they needed at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>“There’s, like, the ‘thespian children’ who choose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, and then there are the working class kids that, in&nbsp;our case, at&nbsp;least... I&nbsp;mean it&nbsp;started, really, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;means to&nbsp;put bread on&nbsp;the table,” Cole <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p><h2>Nevertheless, he&nbsp;has no&nbsp;regrets about taking this path.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc9/e1a/3a6f1c5321927308e5086b5c5e.jpg><p>Despite the challenges and hardships he&nbsp;faced as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child actor, <a href=#>Cole Sprouse</a> has no&nbsp;regrets about his path: “If&nbsp;I&nbsp;were given the same choice again, I’d probably do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again.” In&nbsp;his interview, Cole expressed gratitude for the opportunities that the entertainment industry provided for him and his brother, even if&nbsp;their entry into it&nbsp;was more out of&nbsp;necessity than passion.</p><p>He&nbsp;also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>observed</a> that when someone takes up&nbsp;acting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;passion, they may become disillusioned with the industry’s focus on&nbsp;money: “It’s really intriguing. Like, when you approach this career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;passion, and you’re starting to&nbsp;learn the language of&nbsp;these major studios&nbsp;— and the language is&nbsp;always money&nbsp;— you start to&nbsp;become discontented.”</p><p>Overall, <a href=#>Cole</a>’s experience as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child actor has shaped him into the person he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;grateful for the stability and success that it&nbsp;has provided for him and his family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLCwuMRmqqmqn6rApnnRnq2emZyoeqmxjJqlnWWYnsBurtGoq6GdomLEpr7EZp2oqpOasW61za2mZpmTqbavs4ybnJyZpaiybrvFZphmpZ%2Bjsrp50qKrrpmknryveZdqaWpqY2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./couple-strips-down-in-sexy-frances-got-talent-audition-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Couple STRIPS DOWN In Sexy 'France's Got Talent' Audition [VIDEO]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1228931-big-bang-theorys-aarti-mann-age-measurements-net-worth-husband-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Big Bang Theory's Aarti Mann: age, measurements, net worth, husband</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
