The reasons for this may be&nbsp;different: <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>, the unreliability of&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner, the desire to&nbsp;live for yourself, or&nbsp;simply a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;readiness for this responsibility. The most important thing here is&nbsp;that it’s your life and your choice. And if&nbsp;you decide that you want to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mom after&nbsp;40, then you should know about some advantages and possible drawbacks of&nbsp;a&nbsp;late pregnancy.</p><p>Giving birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby brings so&nbsp;much joy and happiness, but childbearing does come with some risks. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> took a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;pregnancy, in&nbsp;advanced maternal age, from different angles. And we&nbsp;invite you to&nbsp;join&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>Advantages:</h2></p><p><h2>1. You may have a&nbsp;longer lifespan.</h2></p><p>Women who give birth later may have a&nbsp;<strong>better chance of&nbsp;living longer</strong>. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>a&nbsp;study</a>, those who have given birth to&nbsp;their last child while they were under the age of&nbsp;29&nbsp;cut their chances of&nbsp;living to&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;95&nbsp;in&nbsp;half. A&nbsp;possible reason for this may be&nbsp;genetics.</p><p>If&nbsp;the <a href=# title=reproductive data-link=tag>reproductive</a> system of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman at&nbsp;that age is&nbsp;well-functioning, then this may also apply to&nbsp;other processes associated with aging. However, this relationship between giving birth and longevity was mostly true for <strong>women with 3&nbsp;children, or&nbsp;less</strong>.</p><p><h2>2. You can reduce cognitive decline.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c96/e4f/2034e95047bb099132af76484d.jpg><p>Another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> shows the connection between the last pregnancy occurring at&nbsp;a&nbsp;later age and a&nbsp;woman’s <strong>better postmenopausal cognition</strong>. These conclusions were made on&nbsp;the basis of&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;tests that included tasks for various aspects of&nbsp;the brain’s workings.</p><p>In&nbsp;particular, women who give birth after 35&nbsp;have a&nbsp;<strong>better verbal memory</strong>. This may happen because <a href=# title=hormones data-link=tag>hormones</a> affect our brains. And not just any hormones, but estrogen and progesterone, which are also responsible for brain function and the development of&nbsp;brain tissue, respectively.</p><p><h2>3. You are wiser and more experienced at&nbsp;this age.</h2></p><p>It’s no&nbsp;secret that over the years we&nbsp;acquire knowledge and experience. Compare yourself with when you were in&nbsp;your 20s or&nbsp;30s. And now imagine the difference in&nbsp;raising children in&nbsp;these years. <strong>Women over 40&nbsp;are more patient</strong> toward their children and they approach their upbringing with more thoughtfulness.</p><p>Usually during these years, women don’t just become pregnant by&nbsp;chance. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;deliberate step that you’re prepared for. Therefore, you are <strong>more stable emotionally and psychologically</strong>. And you are ready for the changes that come with pregnancy and the birth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.</p><p><h2>4. You are more stable financially.</h2></p><p>By&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40, most women already have a&nbsp;career. They’re not still trying themselves in&nbsp;different areas, constantly changing jobs, or&nbsp;dealing with an&nbsp;unstable income. Women who have children later feel they can allow their career to&nbsp;fade into the background so&nbsp;they can be<strong>&nbsp;more focused on&nbsp;their child</strong>.</p><p>Most likely you already have real estate and savings that will help you to&nbsp;<strong>experience less stress</strong> due to&nbsp;the appearance of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child. Сonsidering that you don’t need to&nbsp;think about a&nbsp;career and work from dusk till dawn to&nbsp;earn extra money, you can devote more time to&nbsp;your baby.</p><p><h2>5. You’ve had time to&nbsp;try everything.</h2></p><p>The period of&nbsp;partying and always being on&nbsp;the go&nbsp;has passed, and now is&nbsp;the time to&nbsp;<strong>plunge into having a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a></strong>. By&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40, you have already accumulated a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;funny memories, managed to&nbsp;feel you’ve hung out with friends enough, and, last but not least, you’ve lived for yourself. You have traveled, explored the world, and expanded your boundaries.</p><p>And when your child is&nbsp;born, you are <strong>less likely to&nbsp;feel dissatisfaction</strong> with the fact that you won’t have all your time just for yourself anymore and you will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;happily devote time to&nbsp;your child.</p><p>But despite the fact that pregnancy after 40&nbsp;has its advantages, it&nbsp;also carries certain threats and drawbacks.</p><p><h2>Risks:</h2></p><p><h2>1. You are less likely to&nbsp;get pregnant.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b3/d48/3f4673535e8fe0cc73e13ed0ce.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the years pass, women have less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;get pregnant. <a href=#>At&nbsp;32&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age</a>, <strong>fertility begins to&nbsp;decline significantly</strong>. The number of&nbsp;eggs decreases and there are less and less of&nbsp;them for fertilization. An&nbsp;incorrect release of&nbsp;eggs by&nbsp;the ovaries can occur and the likelihood of&nbsp;unhealthy eggs being released increases.</p><p>But do&nbsp;not despair, because nowadays there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;use donor eggs. You can also freeze your eggs at&nbsp;an&nbsp;earlier age or&nbsp;resort to&nbsp;surrogate motherhood.</p><p><h2>2. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;higher chance of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;miscarriage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14a/87a/c2c43855a292a592cd1a09ebc1.jpg><p>Risk of&nbsp;<a href=#>miscarriage</a> increases with age and <strong>after 45&nbsp;years old, it&nbsp;can reach&nbsp;50% or&nbsp;more</strong>. Of&nbsp;course, it’s not only age that affects pregnancy loss. But age-related changes influence our body, reduce hormonal and uterine function, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;complicate other factors that can lead to&nbsp;the loss of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fetus.</p><p><h2>3. You have a&nbsp;higher risk of&nbsp;getting osteoporosis.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1b/390/72f6985779850fb2b1accc5ffe.jpg><p>Giving birth at&nbsp;a&nbsp;later age increases the likelihood of&nbsp;developing osteoporosis in&nbsp;elderly women. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>the study</a>, those who gave birth after 35&nbsp;years were <strong>twice as&nbsp;likely</strong> to&nbsp;have this disease. Therefore, you should pay special attention to&nbsp;your bones during pregnancy in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;decrease your chances of&nbsp;osteoporosis in&nbsp;old age.</p><p><h2>4. You have an&nbsp;increased risk of&nbsp;preterm birth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aba/b3d/7ef6c6528388db8306a18b95d1.jpg><p>Advanced age, for childbirth, significantly increases the likelihood that a&nbsp;<strong>baby will be&nbsp;born early </strong>and may have low birth weight. One <a href=#>study</a> shows that age itself, regardless of&nbsp;other negative factors, may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;cause of&nbsp;premature birth.</p><p><h2>5. You may get gestational diabetes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef2/61f/edc93a5f2aa7b73b829421e456.jpg><p>This form of&nbsp;diabetes is&nbsp;temporary, in&nbsp;most cases, and is&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;an&nbsp;insufficient amount of&nbsp;insulin during pregnancy. In&nbsp;pregnant women over&nbsp;40, the risk of&nbsp;developing this pregnancy complication is&nbsp;<strong>increased by&nbsp;74%</strong> according to&nbsp;<a href=#>a&nbsp;study</a>. Therefore, it’s important to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the test for gestational diabetes and then the doctor will prescribe a&nbsp;treatment for you, depending on&nbsp;the results.</p><p>Pregnancy may have disadvantages at&nbsp;any age. A&nbsp;lot depends on&nbsp;the mother and her state of&nbsp;health. And if&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother after&nbsp;40, <strong>your chances are still good for having a&nbsp;healthy pregnancy and giving birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy baby</strong>. But it’s important to&nbsp;understand that you need to&nbsp;pay special attention to&nbsp;your condition and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;consult with your doctor about any issues.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think that women should wait before becoming a&nbsp;mother? Or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;better to&nbsp;give birth earlier?
