And due to&nbsp;her impressive and truly outstanding results, she’s became an&nbsp;internet sensation and now is&nbsp;always glad to&nbsp;share her inspirational story with all the people of&nbsp;all ages and overall background.</p><p><h2>She started to&nbsp;exercise to&nbsp;cope with trauma and depression</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b24/eb5/0927805a84b03cbc32f0db6273.jpg><p>Iris was born in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Ireland data-link=tag>Ireland</a>, where she lived with another 14&nbsp;siblings in&nbsp;a&nbsp;two-bedroom house. Such a&nbsp;humble background made her start working at&nbsp;14, and in&nbsp;16&nbsp;she decided to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;a&nbsp;better life.</p><p>At&nbsp;17, she married and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;year she and her husband had their first child. Unfortunately, after just two months, the baby died of&nbsp;pneumonia. And that was the exact moment when in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;cope with the <a href=# title=trauma data-link=tag>trauma</a> of&nbsp;losing a&nbsp;child, Iris dived into her life-long love for physical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exercises</a>.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started with one literally small step</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20f/224/c3f2725a8f80238f546a5856c2.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea how&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;survive. I&nbsp;was poor, we&nbsp;didn’t have social services back then, and&nbsp;I had no&nbsp;idea how&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;feed the two of&nbsp;us,” says Iris. “I&nbsp;lay in&nbsp;bed hoping to&nbsp;die, but after a&nbsp;few days&nbsp;I realized&nbsp;I wasn’t going to&nbsp;die. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;broken heart, but it&nbsp;wasn’t going to&nbsp;kill&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Surprisingly enough, Iris just began <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>walking</a> and it&nbsp;made her feel better and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>better</a>. “The more I&nbsp;walked, the more&nbsp;I cried and talked to&nbsp;myself,” she explained, “and that was better than just lying in&nbsp;bed. It&nbsp;became my&nbsp;church and sanctuary.”</p><p><h2>She entered her first gym only after moving to&nbsp;the USA</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1de/a01/d4e9c759559d516151e7733a8d.jpg><p>At&nbsp;22, Iris had another son, but when he&nbsp;was just two-moths-old, another tragedy happened&nbsp;— her husband died suddenly, and she found herself alone with a&nbsp;little kid and nobody to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a> her. “I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;people in&nbsp;my&nbsp;situation, and they were all <a href=# title=sad data-link=tag>sad</a> and lonely,” she recalls, “but&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;different.”</p><p>So&nbsp;to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her child and bring him up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;better environment, she made a&nbsp;brave decision and applied for a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nanny in&nbsp;the USA. She got hired in&nbsp;two weeks and moved to&nbsp;America. And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;there where she entered her first <a href=# title=gym data-link=tag>gym</a>.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;was unthinkable for a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;bodybuilder</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b4/e09/fe17905078bbd5bdc09d13d958.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;distraction to&nbsp;her severe depression, she was still walking a&nbsp;lot when finally came across a&nbsp;gym. Yet, in&nbsp;the sixties, women were not allowed to&nbsp;join almost any gym in&nbsp;the country. There were no&nbsp;female bodybuilders to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;to, no&nbsp;books on&nbsp;the topic, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Hopefully, it&nbsp;didn’t stop Iris, and she decided to&nbsp;become the first female bodybuilder to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>empower</a> women through her passion and ambition. And it&nbsp;seems like she’s accomplished the mission despite everything: now she’s believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the world’s oldest bodybuilder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/333/7b6/b8a62b5619a1919e036a135665.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;was unheard of&nbsp;for a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;go&nbsp;into a&nbsp;men’s gym, but for Iris there was no&nbsp;other option. Of&nbsp;course, she would get looks and stares, when she was allowed&nbsp;in. But when she first walked into a&nbsp;gym, she realized she wasn’t depressed there <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anymore</a>. “I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I wasn’t depressed in&nbsp;the gym and&nbsp;I never stopped,” she says.</p><p>Yet, she never went by&nbsp;bodybuilding books, except for some materials by&nbsp;Schwarzenegger. Simply because copying all those techniques wouldn’t work for a&nbsp;woman. So&nbsp;she had to&nbsp;adapt sessions and teach it&nbsp;all to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>herself</a>. All in&nbsp;all, she is&nbsp;fully her own experiment.</p><p><h2>She always had to&nbsp;compete with far younger bodybuilders</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f8/13b/33a4175ba3b846663a60193b69.jpg><p>She participated in&nbsp;her first bodybuilding show when she was already 50. And since she was not only the oldest but the only female bodybuilder at&nbsp;the time, she had to&nbsp;compete against far younger men at&nbsp;first. Of&nbsp;course, they were expected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stronger and better. Yet, Iris still was able to&nbsp;win the second place at&nbsp;50, and went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;take 12&nbsp;first places in&nbsp;the next <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>20&nbsp;years</a>.</p><p><h2>Life is&nbsp;still an&nbsp;everyday struggle for Iris, but she never gives&nbsp;up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c33/074/b62c915b7084e12440be8bdfeb.jpg><p>Once, Iris was even diagnosed with encephalitis when she was 47. She remembers that it ’completely floored’ her. But she fought it&nbsp;and slowly built her strength up&nbsp;and by&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;50&nbsp;was already competing in&nbsp;her first bodybuilding show.</p><p>She reveals she still battles with her depression, though she is&nbsp;now married for almost <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>30&nbsp;years</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man 17&nbsp;years younger than her, has a&nbsp;son and two grandchildren. Nevertheless, over the years, she says she had three nervous breakdowns and without her exercise regime probably wouldn’t be&nbsp;alive <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>today</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4c/3b3/862870576eb5fe06d31a5e017c.jpg><p>“Every day is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>effort</a>,” says Iris and every day she has to&nbsp;struggle and make herself a&nbsp;bit closer to&nbsp;her ideal. And she still is&nbsp;winning despite everything! “That’s my&nbsp;message to&nbsp;people&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you want it&nbsp;enough you’ll do&nbsp;it.” And hopefully, there are many more people out there who prove that age is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;<a href=#>number</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK60wM6noKygmaO0br%2FTqKmyZZ%2BbeqJ5lnJksp2Rp3qwuMNmqqKml6GybrnOpmSwoJ9iwLWt0a2cnWWnpL%2Bstc2gZKitpGLBsHnCqKeeZaeewal5x56pZpyVpb%2Bmv9KipqdlaGaAeIKWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beatboxing-recorder-player-blows-the-judges-minds-on-americas-got-talent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beatboxing Recorder Player Blows the Judges Minds on 'America's Got Talent'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ap-vs-chicago-style.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AP vs. Chicago style: the key differences you should know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
