Ooh, better have insurance. But all these are minor natural disasters compared with the eruption of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=volcano data-link=tag>volcano</a>.</p><p>Some volcanoes can destroy a&nbsp;city, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was with Pompeii. Or&nbsp;some islands in&nbsp;the Pacific <a href=# title=Ocean data-link=tag>Ocean</a>. But there’s a&nbsp;dangerous type of&nbsp;eruption that can destroy all life on&nbsp;the planet. This type is&nbsp;called “flood basalt.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/042/b3d/8e655d5f5b88feac471c9488b9.png><p>But first of&nbsp;all, let’s first figure out <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>what a&nbsp;volcano&nbsp;is</a>. Rivers of&nbsp;hot liquid metals and incandescent rocks flow deep inside our planet. And the deeper it&nbsp;gets, the hotter they are. The source of&nbsp;this hot mass is&nbsp;the mantle, which is&nbsp;the middle layer of&nbsp;Earth, located between the core and the crust. These fiery streams are called magma, and it&nbsp;flows everywhere.</p><p>But we&nbsp;don’t feel its heat because of&nbsp;the thick layer of&nbsp;our planet’s crust. Magma is&nbsp;lighter than the crust, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;always tries to&nbsp;break out to&nbsp;the surface. And in&nbsp;some places, it&nbsp;succeeds. At&nbsp;the junctions of&nbsp;tectonic plates, it&nbsp;splashes out when one plate moves under a&nbsp;thicker one.</p><p>When magma reaches the surface, it&nbsp;becomes lava. This substance burns the ground around and cools down quickly. It&nbsp;hardens and forms a&nbsp;new layer of&nbsp;<a href=# title=rock data-link=tag>rock</a>. The following splash of&nbsp;magma falls on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;this layer. Thus, a&nbsp;mountain appears layer by&nbsp;layer over millions of&nbsp;years. And in&nbsp;its mouth, a&nbsp;fault of&nbsp;tectonic plates splashes out magma.</p><p>This mountain is&nbsp;called a&nbsp;volcano. It&nbsp;spits lava and ash into the sky, then falls asleep and wakes up&nbsp;again during seismic activity. Now imagine that several giant volcanoes begin to&nbsp;splash out an&nbsp;infinite amount of&nbsp;magma. It&nbsp;just doesn’t end and covers an&nbsp;entire continent. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flood basalt</a>. And one day, it&nbsp;did happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/666/68b/f904ce5169b5e69a026ad80fc2.png><p>About 252 million years ago, in&nbsp;the northern part of&nbsp;our planet, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;magma accumulated under Earth’s crust. Trillions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;hot rock were concentrated in&nbsp;one place on&nbsp;a&nbsp;gigantic territory. And gradually, all this fiery energy began to&nbsp;seep out of&nbsp;the ground. Hot gas started to&nbsp;come out in&nbsp;different places in&nbsp;this territory.</p><p>The ground shook endlessly, and the crust rose hundreds of&nbsp;feet. All pointing to&nbsp;the approach of&nbsp;an&nbsp;imminent catastrophe. And then, at&nbsp;some point, magma began to&nbsp;pour out. Giant fountains of&nbsp;fire burst out of&nbsp;the ground. Do&nbsp;you know those geysers in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Iceland data-link=tag>Iceland</a>? So, imagine the same things but dozens of&nbsp;times higher and with hot lava and ash instead of&nbsp;water and steam.</p><p>The ash and lava flows were so&nbsp;strong that they reached the clouds. Under Earth’s crust, there was a&nbsp;gigantic bubble of&nbsp;magma. And it&nbsp;squeezed out fiery jets under the pressure of&nbsp;rock and ground. The rift was getting bigger. Magma was flowing out everywhere. It&nbsp;began to&nbsp;fill the entire North continent. The flood of&nbsp;lava spread wider and wider. The streams of&nbsp;molten rock seemed endless. Layers of&nbsp;molten basalt rock overlapped one another, forming a&nbsp;giant tsunami of&nbsp;lava 160 feet high. It&nbsp;poured out of&nbsp;the ground for hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;years, flooding forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, billions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;volcanic ash rose into the sky which could lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;volcanic winter since sulfur dioxide in&nbsp;the ash reflected the sun’s rays. This might have lowered the temperature on&nbsp;the continent by&nbsp;several degrees. Then, dust and ash probably condensed and formed giant clouds that watered the surface with toxic acid rain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cf9/e92/49cf9f50cb8285552666de4dbe.png><p>After that, the cooled lava formed a&nbsp;giant thick shield preventing magma from seeping out of&nbsp;the endless fire bubble. The global catastrophe was over. But only for a&nbsp;short time. Trillions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;magma were still flowing under a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;solid basalt. The fiery rivers couldn’t reach the top, so&nbsp;they spread out to&nbsp;the sides. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;this expansion, huge nets were formed under the thick rock.</p><p>They ran in&nbsp;different directions like a&nbsp;spider web and heated Earth’s crust. Gasses started coming out from under the surface again. More and more energy accumulated there until an&nbsp;explosion of&nbsp;unimaginable force occurred. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;magma, carbon dioxide and ash escaped to&nbsp;the surface. They filled the <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a> and caused the greenhouse effect. The temperature on&nbsp;the whole planet increased by&nbsp;several degrees. This release provoked another catastrophe that began in&nbsp;the ocean.</p><p>There were deposits of&nbsp;methane, an&nbsp;explosive gas, on&nbsp;the seabed. Under ice-cold water, the methane was frozen and harmless. But the greenhouse effect in&nbsp;the atmosphere warmed up&nbsp;the entire ocean. Millions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;methane began to&nbsp;rise to&nbsp;the surface. This gas is&nbsp;more potent than carbon dioxide. Therefore, when it&nbsp;hit the atmosphere, the temperatures on&nbsp;Earth increased again. The whole globe turned into a&nbsp;hot sauna. In&nbsp;previously cool and humid places, the temperature reached those of&nbsp;the modern Sahara. Of&nbsp;course, most <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a> and insects couldn’t survive such a&nbsp;cataclysm. But ocean life took much more damage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/100/b66/4ef53b55a995a14f7dac7253b4.png><p>The heat and methane reduced the amount of&nbsp;oxygen in&nbsp;the ocean. Fish and other marine life couldn’t survive in&nbsp;such conditions. New problems appeared when anaerobic bacteria started to&nbsp;multiply in&nbsp;non-oxygen water. They fed on&nbsp;methane and carbon dioxide and released hydrogen sulfide&nbsp;— a&nbsp;toxic substance that poisoned water even more. About&nbsp;75% of&nbsp;land animals and&nbsp;95% of&nbsp;the ocean’s inhabitants went extinct.</p><p>This flood basalt eruption was the only disaster in&nbsp;the planet’s history that destroyed almost all <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a> and significantly reduced the insect population. Several species of&nbsp;the hardiest animals managed to&nbsp;survive in&nbsp;these conditions. The planet took about 10&nbsp;million years to&nbsp;recover completely. After that, evolution began a&nbsp;new process of&nbsp;developing life. And here are two pieces of&nbsp;news.</p><p>The bad one is&nbsp;that flood basalts will happen again and will be&nbsp;no&nbsp;less devastating than 252 million years ago. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The good news is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;will happen in&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;years</a>. But when that happens, humanity will need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;prepared. It&nbsp;will start on&nbsp;the ocean floor. First, lava fountains miles high will begin boiling the water and emit sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, where it&nbsp;will reflect sunlight. Along with ash and magma, a&nbsp;massive amount of&nbsp;water vapor will rise into the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3f8/fb4/3c3330583b9c2435c423bf0f84.png><p>Livestock won’t survive, and people will have breathing problems. Acid rain and increased humidity caused by&nbsp;the evaporation of&nbsp;the oceans will lead to&nbsp;the corrosion of&nbsp;buildings. All flights will be&nbsp;canceled. People will have to&nbsp;wear gas masks. Many animals won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;handle this eruption, but humans will adapt quickly.</p><p>But then another and another eruption will follow, and this endless catastrophe will soon deplete the resources of&nbsp;humanity. Plants and trees won’t recover so&nbsp;fast, and oxygen production will be&nbsp;significantly reduced. Let’s hope that humanity will have colonized other planets, including those outside the Solar System, by&nbsp;that time.</p><p>And now, let’s go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the present. Ah... About&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;the seismic activity associated with<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> volcanoes occurs underwater</a>. So, let’s see how ordinary volcanoes on&nbsp;the ocean floor work. Water, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;land, rests on&nbsp;tectonic plates. Therefore, if&nbsp;their structure is&nbsp;broken at&nbsp;the joints, magma seeps through them.</p><p>But unlike terrestrial volcanoes, lava here doesn’t spread in&nbsp;different directions, burning everything it&nbsp;meets. It&nbsp;solidifies under the pressure of&nbsp;cold water. Underwater volcanoes can erupt for a&nbsp;long time with breaks in&nbsp;between. Magma covers the seabed. After another hundred or&nbsp;thousand years, a&nbsp;new eruption begins, and a&nbsp;new layer of&nbsp;rock forms over the previous one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/84a/e9c/8d44d25bdcb89fe4ce7c95f5f2.png><p>Over millions of&nbsp;years, layer by&nbsp;layer, magma is&nbsp;rising. And then, one day, a&nbsp;volcano rises out of&nbsp;the water. Magma splashes out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;and increases its height. And now, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;large volcanic island. Then the volcano falls asleep, and life appears on&nbsp;the newly formed piece of&nbsp;land.</p><p>Magma flows from the planet’s mantle, filled with various chemical elements. This hot mix saturates the soil with useful substances and, thus, promotes the growth of&nbsp;plants and trees. Then birds and other animals arrive there, and the volcanic island turns into a&nbsp;paradise.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpsc1mpJqfnZZ6pbvErKWtZZWjsW7Ax55kpqejqXqlrc2gnKunpah6tcXPnmSonl2av7a806Kmp2VoZoN0fpNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./return-to-movie-theaters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Americans Remain Hesitant to Return to Movie Theaters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./universities-wales.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Welsh universities | Welsh Education</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
