The 19-year-old singer has delivered some knockout performances on Team Blake throughout the competition.</strong></p><p>Cam has been pursuing his dream since a young age. He earned the audience vote during the Live Playoffs, putting him in the Top 9 for the Semifinals. His coach Blake Shelton has called him a “superstar,” and we couldn’t agree more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUWzdk15NY</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-star-cam-anthony-went-viral-at-a-young-age>‘The Voice’ Star Cam Anthony Went Viral at a Young Age</h2><p>Cam has been singing from a young age. His YouTube covers of songs like <a href=#>“When I Was Your Man”</a> by Bruno Mars and <a href=#>“Royals” </a>by Lorde went viral, racking up hundreds of thousands of views. His <a href=#>Facebook cover</a> of “Ain’t No Sunshine” current has over 8 million views. His talent even attracted the attention of Ellen DeGeneres, who invited him on <a href=#>her talk show</a>.</p><p>Cam told the host that he’s been singing since he was 4 years old. His parents apparently heard him singing along to a Folgers commercial, and they realized he had a talent for music. Cam also shared that his math teacher advised him to stay true to himself as his popularity grew.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘THE VOICE’ TOP 20 PERFORMS ‘DYNAMITE’ BY BTS</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-performed-at-the-white-house>Cam Performed at the White House</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In 2014, 12-year-old Cam was invited to the White House to perform the national anthem at the Easter Egg Roll. He stood on the balcony next to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, as well as the Easter Bunny himself, and belted out “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</p><p>In a 2018 <a href=#>interview</a> with talk show host Steve Harvey, Cam shared that even got to play basketball with President Obama during his time at the White House. The young singer marveled, “I played ball with the president of the United States.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-was-signed-by-dr-dre-at-age-14>He Was Signed By Dr. Dre at Age 14</h3><p>Cam’s viral videos and public performances worked to his advantage, as he ended up <a href=#>being signed</a> to Dr. Dre’s record label Aftermath Entertainment in 2015, when he was just 14 years old. He left the label last year, and shortly thereafter was invited to audition for The Voice.</p><p>“I think that this quarantine was necessary for me to make any type of decision like that,” Cam said in <a href=#>an interview</a>. “I think it was time for me to move on from my label, but I just didn’t really know how. And so I think this was just the best opportunity to do so.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-anthony-won-showtime-at-the-apollo>Cam Anthony Won ‘Showtime at the Apollo’</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In 2018, Cam competed on a reboot of Showtime at the Apollo on FOX, hosted by Steve Harvey. He first performed “Thinking Out Loud” by Ed Sheeran, which earned him a place in the finale. He then delivered a show-stopping performance of “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers and ended up winning the entire season.</p><p>“The Apollo was a really big thing!”&nbsp;Cam said in <a href=#>an interview</a> at the time. “It was definitely something that I always wanted to do and the fact that I was able to accomplish that so soon was really exciting and a blessing.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>THE WINNER OF ‘THE VOICE’ FOUR-WAY KNOCKOUT IS …</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-called-cam-a-superstar>Blake Shelton Called Cam a ‘Superstar’</h3><p>During the Live Playoffs, Cam delivered an incredible performance of “Take Me to Church” by Hozier. His coach Shelton was blown away, and made a bold prediction about Cam’s future.</p><p>“You have delivered every time you stand on this stage,” <a href=#>Shelton told him</a>. “I’ve never had more people asking me about an artist on my team, in 20 seasons of doing this show. You could be the first superstar that we launch off this show.”</p><p>We can’t wait to see if Shelton’s prediction is correct, as we’ll soon find out if Cam makes it to the Finals of Season 20.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/David-Walliams.jpeg alt="David Walliams to Judge ‘The Masked Dancer’ in the UK" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJuws6imp5lo6mus3nCmqRmmZ6ptbC62GarnpmdYq%2BtrcqeqmarpaWys7%2FTmqlo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./43645-most-britons-now-know-what-woke.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Most Britons now know what woke is</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jordin-sparks-former-music-producer-says-shes-the-originator-of-ariana-grandes-yours-truly-album.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jordin Sparks' Former Music Producer Says She's The 'Originator of Ariana Grandes 'Yours Truly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
