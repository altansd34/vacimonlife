Three in ten (28%) say they don’t often feel tired upon waking, while just 2% say they’re never tired in the morning.</p><p>Three-quarters (76%) of British women say they very often or fairly often wake up feeling tired, compared to six in ten (59%) men.</p><p>Britons under 40 are most likely to report they very often feel tired in the morning (38-41%) compared to 32% of 40-59-year-olds and just 18% of those 60 and above.</p><p>Three quarters (76%) of night owls say they very often or fairly often wake up feeling tired, compared to 57% of early birds.</p><h3>How hard is it to get out of bed in the morning?</h3><p>Despite the fact that the majority of people often wake up feeling tired, over half (55%) of Britons say it’s very or fairly easy for them to get out of bed in the morning. Four in ten (42%) say it’s difficult, with this being more the case for women (49%) than men (35%).</p><p>Our results also show that Britons under the age of 40 (55-58%) are more likely to say they struggle to get up than those in their 40s and 50s (41%) and those aged 60 and above (26%).</p><p>Six in ten (59%) night owls say it’s difficult for them to get out of bed in the morning, compared to one in five (19%) early risers.</p><h3>Do you tend to hit the snooze button before you get up?</h3><p>Four out of ten Britons (40%) say they hit the snooze button at least once in the morning before getting out of bed, including one in seven (15%) who do so once, 13% who do so twice, and 12% who do so three times or more.</p><p>Women are more likely than men (15% vs 8%) to hit the snooze button three times or more in the morning.</p><p>A third of Britons (36%) never hit the snooze button, while 22% say they don’t set an alarm at all.</p><h3>When you wake up in the morning, do you get up straight away or spend some time in bed?</h3><p>Seven in ten (68%) Britons prefer to spend some time in bed in the morning once they wake up. A third (37%) spend up to 10 minutes, 14% spend 10-20 minutes and 9% spend 20-30 minutes in bed after waking up. One in 12 (8%) spend more than half an hour in bed before they get up in the morning.</p><p>A quarter (27%) of 16-24-year-olds prefer to spend more than 20 minutes in bed in the morning, which is higher than across other age groups (13-19%). Young men are more likely than young women to loiter under the covers, at 31% vs 24%.</p><p>One in three Britons (28%) say they get up immediately once they wake up, with this applying notably more to men (32%) than women (24%). Britons aged 40-59 (37%) are most likely to get up straight away compared to 11% of 16-24-year-olds and 22% of 25-39-year-olds. Among those 60 and above, three in ten (31%) say they get up straight away.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZm1qaWmGbsXOrp6orl2ouaaxz2aqra2UrnqxrdGtZKyhqGLEorfIp55mpZ%2Bnu6q6xg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1199319-top-10-hotels-nigeria-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 hotels in Nigeria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1418178-tattoo-model-laurence-bedards-biography-age-measurements-sister-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tattoo model Laurence Bedard's biography: age, measurements, sister</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
