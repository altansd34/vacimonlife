Dogs come in&nbsp;all shapes, colors, and sizes, and according to&nbsp;the American Kennel Club, labradors, bulldogs, poodles, and dachshunds are the norm on&nbsp;US streets. But what about those breeds that you don’t get to&nbsp;see every day? There are several unique paws out there that can leave you scratching your head, wondering what exact breed they are.</p><p>We&nbsp;can’t resist learning something new here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, so&nbsp;grab a&nbsp;jacket and some treats, and let’s take these 10&nbsp;unique dog breeds for a&nbsp;walk around the neighborhood. We’re pretty sure those special doggos will make jaws drop all around them.</p><p><h2>Pomeranian Spitz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ce/da0/0d98ee5b11b9371c4b636794b3.jpg><p>Pomeranians were developed in&nbsp;the province of&nbsp;Pomerania from the ancient Spitz breeds. They love meeting new people, they are good with kids, and they get along well with other animals. These tiny dogs are very active indoors and are good choices for apartments. This dog has been popular among royals since the eighteenth century&nbsp;— at&nbsp;one time, <a href=# title="Queen Victoria" data-link=tag>Queen Victoria</a> had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>35</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;them in&nbsp;the royal kennels.</p><p>These animals are super friendly, lively, and playful, but they can be&nbsp;temperamental with other dogs and people to&nbsp;prove their dominance. Although they are small, they tend to&nbsp;bark a&nbsp;lot due to&nbsp;their defensiveness when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are smart and can be&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;receiving what they wish from their owners. They love to&nbsp;be&nbsp;put first and are a&nbsp;bit stubborn. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;train your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pomeranian</a> properly, using toys may help.</p><p><h2>Dogo Argentino</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/655/bec/77536c5e31a6f50861ef40d2a3.jpg><p>This dog will serve its owners as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loyal hunter and guardian. It&nbsp;asks for constant training and firm leadership, and the response is&nbsp;often impressive due to&nbsp;its high intelligence level. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;big and has short white hair with some black spots on&nbsp;the skin. It’s very muscular, and its body is&nbsp;quite strong. This breed’s height can differ between males and females.</p><p>If&nbsp;you know what an&nbsp;American Bulldog and American Pit Bull Terrier look like, you might have a&nbsp;general idea of&nbsp;what this breed has to&nbsp;offer. These <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doggos</a> are generally trained for search and rescue, police assistance, assisting the blind, and service. They’re very smart and courageous&nbsp;— they instinctively want to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;and protect their home and family. They don’t like being left out during family gatherings, but one of&nbsp;their flaws is&nbsp;that they’re very temperamental.</p><p><h2>Akita</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef5/4db/7d516d58b0b9103a4b69a694e5.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Akitas</a> originated in&nbsp;Japan, but today there are 2&nbsp;separate varieties: a&nbsp;Japanese strain and an&nbsp;American strain. These dogs are very loyal, but they can also be&nbsp;stubborn and dominant and require a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;training. They have a&nbsp;big head with triangle ears, and their eyes are small and dark. They have thick hair, and their feet look similar to&nbsp;those of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat.</p><p>Generally, these dogs can have red, sesame, brindle, and white fur. Akitas are very low-maintenance when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;grooming needs&nbsp;— they groom themselves as&nbsp;cats&nbsp;do, and if&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for them, it&nbsp;shouldn’t be&nbsp;difficult. They shed quite a&nbsp;lot, so&nbsp;daily brushing may be&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent way to&nbsp;reduce the issue. They need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bathed every few months, but you may do&nbsp;it&nbsp;more often, depending on&nbsp;your needs.</p><p>Also, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;advisable to&nbsp;clean their ears once a&nbsp;week and cut their toenails each month&nbsp;— they are quite the princesses. Akitas are very territorial about their home and shy away from strangers. One flaw they have is&nbsp;that they don’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tolerate</a> other dogs of&nbsp;the same gender.</p><p><h2>Rottweiler</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/344/938/dad35c5387910a194f1245ac78.jpg><p>Historically, this was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>herding</a> breed. But today, these dogs are good guardians and very protective of&nbsp;their families. They are often used as&nbsp;search and rescue dogs, police dogs, and guide dogs. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered one of&nbsp;the oldest dog breeds and goes way back to&nbsp;Roman times.</p><p>Back then, they were considered the driving dogs&nbsp;— they would be&nbsp;natural caretakers, protect people, and drive their cattle. Now, we&nbsp;see them as&nbsp;strong, firm dogs with deep chests and layered coats. Their undercoat may not be&nbsp;present if&nbsp;they live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot area. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rottweilers</a> are low-maintenance, but they shed a&nbsp;lot, and if&nbsp;they have a&nbsp;long or&nbsp;wavy coat, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;flaw for this breed.</p><p><h2>Pharaoh Hound</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f33/351/9859805e9a80d76a2ad92688bc.jpg><p>Though they look exactly like ancient Egyptian dogs, they have no&nbsp;Egyptian ancestry. Their origin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mystery and they are intelligent, active, and friendly. And these dogs “blush” when they get excited: their nose and ears turn a&nbsp;deep rose color. They’re slender and graceful&nbsp;— their head is&nbsp;long, and their hair is&nbsp;very short but glowing.</p><p>Because they have short hair, they don’t need much brushing&nbsp;— it&nbsp;is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;brush it&nbsp;lightly every day or&nbsp;each weak, heavily. Bathing them isn’t that necessary unless they really need it&nbsp;because they have sensitive skin, so&nbsp;too much bathing might not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea. However, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pharaoh’s</a> ears must be&nbsp;clean and their nails trimmed regularly. Taking care of&nbsp;their teeth is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;must; they need professional dental cleanings, and you may brush their teeth at&nbsp;home as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>Azawakh</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/579/6dd/3bc55f5dee9aa8a32390239cc9.jpg><p>This African breed is&nbsp;comprised of&nbsp;hunters that can reach speeds of&nbsp;40&nbsp;miles per hour. They need lots of&nbsp;physical activity and are amiable and love their humans and other dogs. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Azawakh</a> breed is&nbsp;highly attached to&nbsp;their owners, but they can also get along without them. With people and other animals that they accept, they’re very friendly, gentle, and affectionate.</p><p>However, with strangers, they are reserved and don’t like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;petted, but this doesn’t mean they’re aggressive. They generally don’t attack, even though they are raised to&nbsp;protect their loved ones from predators. But if&nbsp;they are threatened, then they certainly&nbsp;do. They have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;high energy and great endurance, and if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;runner, it’s a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;take this breed along with you.</p><p>But try to&nbsp;avoid taking them out in&nbsp;the rain or&nbsp;cold weather, as&nbsp;they aren’t big fans of&nbsp;it. Not only are they fast and well built, but they’re also smart&nbsp;— they have a&nbsp;great memory and can recognize faces, even after a&nbsp;long time of&nbsp;not seeing them.</p><p><h2>Tibetan Mastiff</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ab/e0b/7709c15cc4a42a6de1754ffb39.jpg><p>Ancient nomadic tribes of&nbsp;China, Nepal, and Tibet used these dogs to&nbsp;protect sheep from predators. The Tibetan Mastiff is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the world’s largest and most protective breeds. These dogs can reach 33&nbsp;inches in&nbsp;height and weigh 160&nbsp;pounds. These dogs aren’t very comfortable in&nbsp;apartments or&nbsp;small spaces&nbsp;— a&nbsp;big, spacious yard is&nbsp;more enjoyable for them.</p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;their personality, they are very easy-going and protective. However, it’s advisable not to&nbsp;leave them alone with strangers throughout the night since they are more active, alert, and aware. They like to&nbsp;get cozy and sleep during the day, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended to&nbsp;get them obedience training since they are very smart but stubborn. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tibetan mastiffs</a> are great family dogs unless the family isn’t properly training them.</p><p><h2>Chow Chow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/935/c50/b14d8e53c69a95a1ef89d4a14d.png><p>This Chinese breed is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the oldest dog breeds in&nbsp;existence today, and they used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good at&nbsp;herding, hunting, guarding, and pulling. Today, they are good companions and come in&nbsp;multiple colors, including red, black, blue, cinnamon, and cream. They also have a&nbsp;unique black tongue. They don’t really trust strangers and can become overprotective of&nbsp;their owners and territory.</p><p>They aren’t too active, so&nbsp;living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house suits them, but they will need exercise to&nbsp;prevent boredom and restlessness. Although they protect all family members, they are overprotective of&nbsp;only 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;members. Engaging with them when they are puppies is&nbsp;essential so&nbsp;they can adjust when they get older. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chow chows</a> are generally easy-going by&nbsp;nature, but they can get aggressive toward dogs of&nbsp;the same gender (especially their own breed).</p><p><h2>Löwchens</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Löwchen</a> means “little lion” in&nbsp;German, and this breed is&nbsp;often given a&nbsp;“lion” trim too. They have been recognized as&nbsp;a&nbsp;breed since the Renaissance and can even be&nbsp;spotted in&nbsp;some Renaissance paintings. This used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog for noblemen, but nowadays, it’s pretty rare.</p><p>They are known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very friendly, healthy, and happy dogs. Playful, active, and intelligent, these dogs are great house pets, especially if&nbsp;there are children around. They don’t like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;left alone for a&nbsp;long time and need quite a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;attention from their owners.</p><p><h2>Samoyed</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc0/531/faa8a9516880a8455f66ae555e.jpg><p>This fluffy beauty was bred in&nbsp;Siberia to&nbsp;help herd reindeer and pull sleds. Their upturned mouths look like a&nbsp;smile, making them charming and helpful friends and companions. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Samoyeds</a> don’t make good guards&nbsp;— they are a&nbsp;happy, smiley type of&nbsp;dog. However, they tend to&nbsp;bark a&nbsp;lot when someone comes into their territory.</p><p>Nevertheless, they’re great friends for kids and even other dogs. One unique characteristic of&nbsp;theirs is&nbsp;that they stay playful, even at&nbsp;an&nbsp;old age. But they can get bored, become a&nbsp;bit destructive, and start digging, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;walk them more often and keep them entertained.</p><p>Did you enjoy walking alongside all these great dog breeds? Do&nbsp;you know or&nbsp;own a&nbsp;dog from a&nbsp;breed that most people don’t see as&nbsp;frequently every day? What is&nbsp;the most memorable dog breed you’ve seen?
