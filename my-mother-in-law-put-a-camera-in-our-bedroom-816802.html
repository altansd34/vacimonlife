A&nbsp;few hours later, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she</a> found a&nbsp;hidden camera in&nbsp;her bedroom. Total invasion of&nbsp;privacy. Trust issues? You bet. Now, she’s on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mission to&nbsp;figure out who else has been spying on&nbsp;her and how long it’s been going&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>The woman told the whole story and left anyone shocked</h2></p><p>“My&nbsp;husband (M33) got into a&nbsp;car accident almost a&nbsp;month ago. He’s been bedridden due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;back injury, and I’ve been his primary caregiver. The pressure has been too much from my&nbsp;MIL; she keeps telling me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;him and be&nbsp;there for him constantly. She begged me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take time off work, and I&nbsp;did. She asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2&nbsp;weeks), but when&nbsp;I didn’t, she’d get mad and cause an&nbsp;issue. She visits every day but doesn’t do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;help; alternatively, she lists all the things&nbsp;I should or&nbsp;shouldn’t do. The <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> keeps telling me&nbsp;she’s just worried sick for her son, so&nbsp;I try to&nbsp;stay calm.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/455/d82/21c53159b89144cfc5040c2b8d.jpg><p>“Days ago, she called to&nbsp;berate me&nbsp;about not replacing the sheets quickly. I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea how she found out since my&nbsp;husband didn’t call her. My&nbsp;sister-in-law called me&nbsp;to&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;that her mom installed a&nbsp;camera in&nbsp;the bedroom to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;I was taking proper care of&nbsp;her son. I&nbsp;was stunned; after searching the room, I&nbsp;found the camera. I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;MIL and had a&nbsp;huge fight with her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cce/f20/1a5fce5df4912c1c6a2f6ad071.jpg><p>“She admitted it&nbsp;and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to&nbsp;make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her every day). I&nbsp;yelled at&nbsp;her, telling her that she was no&nbsp;longer allowed into my&nbsp;home after this. She lost it&nbsp;and went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rant about how&nbsp;I was stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him would literally make her sick herself.</p><p>The family called me&nbsp;later to&nbsp;get me&nbsp;to&nbsp;back out of&nbsp;this decision, but&nbsp;I told them she breached my&nbsp;privacy and taken advantage of&nbsp;the situation. They said&nbsp;I was taking it&nbsp;too personally and that&nbsp;I couldn’t blame a&nbsp;concerned mother for wanting to&nbsp;make sure her son’s fine, especially since she listed things she thought&nbsp;I was doing wrong. I&nbsp;ended the conversation, but my&nbsp;husband was upset, telling me&nbsp;I was being vindictive and that if&nbsp;his mom couldn’t come, then he’d move there with her. We&nbsp;argued, then&nbsp;I went outside, and he’s been silent ever since.”</p><p><h2>Redditors gave the woman mixed suggestions</h2></p><ul><li>Report it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the police. Let your husband go&nbsp;home to&nbsp;his mummy. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Novykh&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><ul><li>Let your husband move out, then. That woman should be&nbsp;arrested! What kind of&nbsp;family is&nbsp;this? Get out of&nbsp;dodge before you are entangled with children. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>13jopbjr&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acf/cdd/ed1ac55801887a0e6089a776e0.jpg><ul><li>Where’s the conflict? The <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> is&nbsp;probably over, but have you not realized your husband knew about the camera? She installed it&nbsp;while he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the room. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Glittering-W**-5748&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>You could have been getting dressed. You could have had some ’alone time’. There were so&nbsp;many things she could have seen that she had no&nbsp;right&nbsp;to. I&nbsp;don’t even think I’d talk to&nbsp;her. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Auroraburst&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>You’re not stopping her from seeing her son; you’re preventing her from literally breaching your privacy in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the worst ways she could possibly do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again. She had no&nbsp;right to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;camera in&nbsp;your bedroom, let alone anywhere in&nbsp;your house whatsoever just because she was concerned. She should’ve just offered to&nbsp;help whenever she came over instead of&nbsp;just giving you a&nbsp;list (I’m sure you know how to&nbsp;care for your husband) and secretly installing a&nbsp;camera. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Silver_ghost17&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/517/584/3a0dd05905aab70d4eeac7d738.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;think your husband moving in&nbsp;with his mom while recovering is&nbsp;the best idea, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;will receive the proper care his family thinks he&nbsp;deserves. He&nbsp;wants&nbsp;it, MIL wants&nbsp;it, let them have&nbsp;it. Just let him know you will take him back anytime he&nbsp;wants&nbsp;it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>tatasz&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><ul><li>Let him move in&nbsp;with her.

His behavior is&nbsp;absolutely appalling. He&nbsp;blames you for every bad thing that happened to&nbsp;him and his family, as&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;your last post. That is&nbsp;abuse. Straight up. You need to&nbsp;run&nbsp;OP; it&nbsp;will only get worse from here on&nbsp;out. He’s starting to&nbsp;show his real colors. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>xrumkugelx&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>He’s bedridden so&nbsp;it’s not like he&nbsp;wasn’t aware himself of&nbsp;the camera. Mom had to&nbsp;install it&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;him. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>HomingSnail&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>It&nbsp;sounds like he&nbsp;doesn’t respect you sufficiently, and isn’t even protecting your privacy and safety of&nbsp;the home, despite you being his primary caregiver. His decision to&nbsp;blame you, not his meddling, creepy mother, speaks volumes. Honestly, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;reassessing my&nbsp;marriage in&nbsp;your shoes. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>ChenilleSocks&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><p>There are loads of&nbsp;stories out there about mothers-in-law doing sneaky stuff their in-laws don’t know about, just like this one where a&nbsp;mom-in-law cut her baby <a href=#>daughter</a>’s hair on&nbsp;the sly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecyoq6GdomK2r3nLmq5mqKWpeqJ5wpqknqqRYravec6uqWaalZm%2FsLvMZm9qbmhlf3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./name-image-likeness-rights.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Name Image Likeness Rights News and Analysis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./my-boyfriend-thinks-my-dads-gifts-are-creepy-817572.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>My Boyfriend Thinks My Dads Gifts Are Creepy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
