Many remember her from America’s Got Talent, where she performed her hit song ‘It’s OK’ and inspired millions of people around the globe with her messages of faith and never giving up. Those who knew her, enjoyed her larger-than-life personality and sense of humor. She had a witty joke for every occasion—even if the joke was on her. Her lasting legacy will be the gift of hope she gave to so many through her music and the strength she found in Jesus.”</p><p>In her last Instagram post, shared five weeks ago, Nightbirde updated fans on her health. She stated: “Honestly, things have been pretty brutal. But this is a photo of myself from last week where I felt pretty, and alive, and awake, and human, and real. I needed that. We’re all a little lost and it’s alright.”</p><p>Nightbirde inspired fans across the globe when she appeared on AGT with her original song “It’s Okay.” Although her health took a turn for the worse at the beginning of the season, Nightbirde continued to update fans as her original songs climbed the charts.</p><p>“I wish we would get a faster miracle,” Nightbirde said during a CNN interview. “But it’s happening slow, little by little, day by day. I’m doing a little better. I did get a scan result back, and a bunch of stuff that was there has now disappeared.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-flock-to-support-remember-nightbirde>Fans Flock to Support, Remember Nightbirde</h2><p>AGT judge Howie Mandel was the first member of the Got Talent family to comment on Nightbirde’s death. This morning he Tweeted: “<a href=#>@_nightbirde</a> was such a bright inspirational light in all our lives.we must continue to live and learn from her words and lyrics. As much as I feel horribly about her passing I feel lucky to to have met, heard and known her.”</p><p>Host Terry Crews also offered his condolences to Nightbirde’s family and friends via social media.</p><p>Nightbirde stole America’s hearts during her audition thanks to her positive attitude and angelic vocals. Before her audition, she gave&nbsp;<a href=#>Crews</a>&nbsp;information about her diagnosis that left audiences feeling hopeful:</p><p>“I have a 2% chance of survival, but 2% is not 0%. 2% is something, and I wish people knew how amazing it is,” she said.</p><p>Nightbirde was the first person to receive the Golden Buzzer during Season 16. After her performance of “It’s OK” left Cowell near tears, he pushed his Golden Buzzer, sending her straight through to the live shows. After the audition aired, fans were overcome with her positivity and strength. “It’s OK” topped the iTunes charts within 24 hours of her audition, and continues to bring fans joy and hope.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/161511_7054_02-1-scaled-e1645463763591.jpg alt="What is the Platinum Ticket on ‘American Idol’ Season 20?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yKeqqaGinruoecCgq2armaO0pr6Mp6CgoKSXtrOwxGabop2jYq6utcNmpqefn567qHnCmqWcnaJir6LA06WcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./37065-my-phone-listening-my-conversations-britons-believ.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is my phone listening to my conversations?
