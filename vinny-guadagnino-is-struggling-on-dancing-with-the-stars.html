However, he still wasn’t spared from the judges’ blunt criticisms. Recently, he talked to his fans about his struggles in the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vinny-guadagnino-faces-tough-time-on-dwts>Vinny Guadagnino Faces Tough Time on DWTS</h2><p>It was a sultry week performance for DWTS dancing duos as they showcase their moves for a James Bond themed night. Unfortunately, Vinny Guadagnino and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Koko Iwasaki</a> were given a 23 out of 10 after dancing rumba to “Thunderball” by Tom Jones. The low score almost landed them in the bottom two in the leaderboard, but luckily fan votes made them safe from elimination.</p><p>After the live episode, Vinny went to Instagram to thank his fans. Within the live stream, many noticed that he looked tired and sad while talking. Nonetheless, Vinny didn’t hold back, he stated that while the show is fun, it gets “very challenging” for him.</p><p>“I’m not a dancer, and I just, I don’t know what’s gonna happen every week,” he said. “So, just want to say thank you and I’m going to keep pushing forward.”</p><p>On October 3, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS judges</a> commented that his “Thunderball” performance wasn’t his strongest dance among all. Additionally, Carrie Ann Inaba advised that he should rehearse more, perhaps one or two more hours a day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Needs to Work on Dance Techniques More</h2><p>The Jersey Shore star isn’t a complete beginning at dancing, since he has also competed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Dancer</a> before. However, ballroom dancing is dance style that required specific and intricate techniques. Obviously, Vinny still needs to get the hang of it.</p><p>In his Instagram story, he said that will try to find dances that will best fit him. Now, what he’s confident about is that he’s being himself on stage.</p><p>“I’m being myself out there, ultimately, and that’s what matters, right?” he said.</p><p>In the past weeks, he has received comments from Inaba that he needs to work on the technicality of the dances. Vinny agreed with the suggestion and is determined to make progress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Continue to Cheer Vinny on</h2><p>Amid the unpleasant time, Vinny’s fans expressed their concern for him. On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Reddit</a>, the DWTS star was flooded with encouragement and support.</p><p>“They really are putting him on a rollercoaster. I like Vinny and I hope he hangs in there,” a fan wrote.</p><p>Some fans believed that Vinny has improved a lot, while others hoped that the show is not affecting him too much mentally.</p><p>“No one is more passionate or dedicated than Vinny this season and that’s a fact. You can tell how bad he wants it and that’s why he gets my votes each week,” another fan wrote.</p><p>Indeed, Vinny’s journey in the show has been tough so far, but props to the fans for the all out support. Dancing With the Stars premieres weekly on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Be sure to tune in and vote if you want Vinny’s journey on the series to continue.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_CalebLeeHutchinson_Jason-KempinGetty-Images.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Runner-Up Caleb Lee Hutchinson Opens Up About Eating Disorder Struggles" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571aKlp7FdnMKisMCgpaKmn2K2tHnSramun5ehtq%2BzjKilZpyRo7CqusZmrqKsmGLBqbGMrKuaqqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./we-compared-how-clothing-on-the-runway-looks-on-models-and-celebrities-and-we-cant-decide-who-impressed-us-more-797901.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>We Compared How Clothing on the Runway Looks on Models and Celebrities, and We Cant Decide Who Im</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./subtitle-use-preferences-by-generation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Video Streamers Must Pay More Attention to Subtitles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
