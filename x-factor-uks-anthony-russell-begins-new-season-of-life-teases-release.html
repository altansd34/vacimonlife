Instead, he returned to the series, finishing it out as a finalist. Here’s what this singer is up to now.</strong></p><p>I think most people are afraid to be told that they need singing lessons when auditioning for a series Simon Cowell is apart of. Russell didn’t let this minor detail turn him away from success on the series. He originally auditioned for <a href=#>season four</a> of X Factor UK at 17 years old, but was eliminated during the bootcamp round.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anthony-russell-wins-third-place-in-the-x-factor-uk-series-15>Anthony Russell Wins Third Place in the X Factor UK Series 15</h2><p>Nearly 10 years later, Russell showed back up to the X Factor UK stage and impressed in series 14. Fans are unsure of whether this singer took Cowell’s advice or not, but he clearly was better. His voice the judges, he has an insane contrast between his talking voice and soulful singing voice. Russell advanced past the bootcamp and six chair challenge rounds of the competition but reportedly withdrew before judges homes. His departure was due to personal reasons at the time.</p><p>A year later, Russell re-auditioned for X Factor UK and had his best season yet. Not only did he make it past the bootcamp round, he made it all the way to the finale. This singer was mentored by Louis Tomlinson in the boys category during this run of the competition in series 15. Russell finished in third place overall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Following his success on the X Factor UK he joined the X Factor live tour. This singer missed the final shows of the tour after withdrawing due to personal reasons. It’s <a href=#>been reported</a> that the 29 year old singer was forced into withdrawing from the tour after drugs were found in his hotel room. Following his departure from the series, Russell addressed his fans and let them know that he would no longer be performing in his hometown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-he-up-to-now>What is He Up to Now?</h2><p>In current day, Russell just celebrated <a href=#>two years</a> of sobriety and is beginning a new chapter of his life. At this time, it seems like his Instagram has been completely wipe. Right now, the account features three photos dating back to February 2022. He seems to be more active on his TikTok page in the recent months. In early March he shared that he was apart of the Capstone Theatre’s production of Wildflowers.</p><p>On top of that he’s recently teased an upcoming project named Give Me Reason on all social media platforms. He’s primarily been teasing the upcoming release on both TikTok and Instagram. These teasers have included a photo of him in a recording studio, another of him being filmed, and a <a href=#>muted video</a> that looks like a music video. Since finishing the competition, Russell has released <a href=#>one single</a> to streaming.</p><p>Russell has not yet shared a release date for the upcoming project, but he has urged fans to follow him on TikTok ahead of it. I can’t wait to hear this soulful singer’s upcoming release!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Leah-Jenea.png alt="What to Know About ‘The Four: Battle to Stardom’ Standout, Leah Jenea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5712admpukpL9uwcqsZJqmpJ28r8WMq6ysq5WhuW6uxKCgp6tdo7K4edKemKynnmK8p3nLop2eZaSarrSx0mapnqSVlsCmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./11-year-old-mariachi-singer-stuns-in-agt-early-release-audition.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11-Year-Old Mariachi Singer Stuns in 'AGT' Early Release Audition</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-voice-alum-bella-denapoli-looks-back-at-grueling-journey-on-the-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Voice' Alum Bella DeNapoli Looks Back at Grueling Journey On The Show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
