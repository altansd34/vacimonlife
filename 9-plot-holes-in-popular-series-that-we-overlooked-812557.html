It’s no&nbsp;wonder that even the creators sometimes forget what they came up&nbsp;with in&nbsp;earlier episodes. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, plot holes arise that do&nbsp;not give attentive viewers any peace whatsoever.</p><p><h2><i>The Witcher</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cca/b08/4dd4fe5c94b912d07a192421b8.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the magical world of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, fertility is&nbsp;mostly non-existent. In&nbsp;Yennefer’s case, this is&nbsp;the price she voluntarily paid for her beauty and magical abilities. Nevertheless, the sorceress secretly seeks a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;restore her fertility and even risks her life for&nbsp;it.</p><p>This development for Yennefer seems very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inconsistent</a> to&nbsp;viewers. After all, at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the series, she showed absolutely no&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;have children. And just a&nbsp;few episodes later, she passionately wants to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother.</p><p><h2><i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/50d/d28/6fa73951539fc55098f111cf1d.jpg><p>Fans of&nbsp;the sitcom are still wondering when exactly Chandler and Rachel’s friendship began. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;the pilot episode when Rachel stormed into the coffee shop in&nbsp;her wedding dress, and Monica introduced her to&nbsp;everyone.</p><p>But later in&nbsp;the sitcom, there are flashbacks that suggest Rachel and Chandler have known each other since their teenage years. They celebrated Thanksgiving together and even kissed in&nbsp;college. All of&nbsp;this doesn’t quite fit together into a&nbsp;cohesive picture.</p><p><h2><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02d/c25/e894fe5ff197606ddf9c803474.jpg><p>In&nbsp;season 7&nbsp;of&nbsp;the series, the biggest weakness of&nbsp;the White Walkers was revealed: they are afraid of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>water</a>. However, this limitation was paused momentarily when, by&nbsp;order of&nbsp;the Night King, the Walkers pulled the dragon Viserion out of&nbsp;the icy water he&nbsp;fell into after being struck by&nbsp;a&nbsp;spear. From the scene, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear that the undead had to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the lake and tie the dragon up&nbsp;with chains, but how they did it&nbsp;in&nbsp;practice remains a&nbsp;mystery.</p><p><h2><i>Gossip Girl</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b6/8fe/c579495141ba47686bd38e1819.jpg><p>The reveal of&nbsp;the climax turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete failure. There were enough scenes in&nbsp;the series where Dan was extremely surprised by&nbsp;the news about Serena or&nbsp;about himself that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ruled out</a> any possibility of&nbsp;him being Gossip Girl. Moreover, Gossip Girl was sending messages about the personal life of&nbsp;his sister, Jenny Humphrey, which Dan would never have done.</p><p>In&nbsp;light of&nbsp;all this, the series finale becomes controversial: the person who had caused so&nbsp;much harm to&nbsp;other characters finally fulfills all his dreams and marries the most beautiful girl in&nbsp;Manhattan.</p><p><h2><i>The Office</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bd/06e/933de75304969dfa117fb6735b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the final season of<i>&nbsp;The Office</i>, the characters finally <a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> to&nbsp;watch a&nbsp;documentary about their lives that had been filmed for almost 10&nbsp;years. They were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shocked</a> by&nbsp;what they saw, which seemed like a&nbsp;very inconsistent reaction to&nbsp;the viewers. After all, the characters knew about the filming crew, and throughout the series, they willingly gave interviews and shared personal details of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p><h2><i>The White Lotus</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e2/886/e12a905257837a50091b371cad.jpg><p>Plot-wise, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;American tourists spend their vacation at&nbsp;a&nbsp;luxurious hotel in&nbsp;Sicily. Every evening, all of&nbsp;the guests gather in&nbsp;the hotel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>restaurant</a> for dinner.</p><p>Since the first episode, the viewers have been bothered by&nbsp;one question: Why do&nbsp;all the characters eat at&nbsp;the hotel every night when they are in&nbsp;Italy? Even the characters themselves occasionally hint at&nbsp;how strange this&nbsp;is. In&nbsp;one episode, a&nbsp;character complains, “I&nbsp;don’t know why they keep bringing&nbsp;us these menus. We&nbsp;already know them by&nbsp;heart.”</p><p>From a&nbsp;plot perspective, it&nbsp;makes sense to&nbsp;keep all the characters in&nbsp;one place. More interactions occur between guests, which leads to&nbsp;more potential for awkward situations and increasing tension. However, the situation itself seems somewhat fake.</p><p><h2><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/493/87b/34e2805107ac373de925ac8395.jpg><p>Leonard warns his <a href=# title=friend data-link=tag>friend</a> and colleague Howard Wolowitz that the elevator in&nbsp;their building is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>broken</a> when he&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;call&nbsp;it. This leads viewers to&nbsp;believe that Howard was unaware of&nbsp;the elevator being broken. However, several episodes later, we&nbsp;find out exactly how it&nbsp;broke.</p><p>The elevator was damaged during an&nbsp;experiment by&nbsp;Leonard, and Howard was also present when it&nbsp;happened. This raises the question: How could this be&nbsp;news to&nbsp;Wolowitz if&nbsp;he&nbsp;witnessed it&nbsp;with his own eyes?</p><p><h2><i>Wednesday</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/390/532/d8ce085ebeaf053436536be612.jpg><p>Wednesday was transferred to&nbsp;Nevermore Academy after she punished hooligans in&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind-of brutal way. This act was the last straw for her parents. And, before this, she attended a&nbsp;regular high school.</p><p>Her transfer to&nbsp;a&nbsp;school for outcasts creates a&nbsp;plot hole. It&nbsp;becomes clear that only unusual children with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>extraordinary</a> abilities are accepted there. This undoubtedly applies to&nbsp;Wednesday, who has visions. However, she carefully hides this from her parents and immediately makes it&nbsp;clear to&nbsp;viewers that no&nbsp;one knows about her gift. If&nbsp;all this is&nbsp;true, Wednesday should never have been accepted to&nbsp;Nevermore.</p><p><h2><i>And Just Like That...</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c02/535/f964615f76948af52eef519084.jpg><p>From the beginning, fans of&nbsp;the show had one big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>question</a>: Why didn’t Carrie call an&nbsp;ambulance when she found her husband having a&nbsp;heart attack? The character comes home and finds Mr. Big unconscious in&nbsp;the shower. Instead of&nbsp;immediately calling for an&nbsp;ambulance, she rushes to&nbsp;him and hugs him.</p><p>Eventually, Sarah Jessica Parker herself commented on&nbsp;this plot hole, explaining that she was trying to&nbsp;portray the shock Carrie would’ve felt in&nbsp;that situation. Later, off-screen, her character regained her senses and called 911.</p><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;learn more about good series that are worth your time, here are some more articles:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuvMuoq2agn6GytHnIp2Spp6CquaK%2BjKycq6GVqHq1tMCtZLCdXaTDpr7LqKaknZRihXJ%2BlG5uaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-couple-revealed-how-they-lost-215-lbs-in-less-than-a-year-and-their-transformation-blew-us-away-814711.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Couple Shares How They Lost 215 Pounds in a Year and Why They Started</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./76-year-old-grandmother-is-body-shamed-for-her-outfit-choices-but-her-answer-to-haters-is-priceless-816606.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>76-Year-Old Grandmother Is Body-Shamed for Her Outfit Choices, but Her Answer to Haters Is Priceless</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
