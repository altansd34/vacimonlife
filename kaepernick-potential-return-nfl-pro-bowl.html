hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>completed a workout</a> with the Las Vegas Raiders last month, his first since being blacklisted by the league after he knelt during the national anthem years ago to protest racial injustice and police brutality in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A new Morning Consult survey reveals that nearly 3 in 5 self-identified NFL fans (57%) believe Kaepernick should be given a chance to return after more than five years on the sidelines, but their interest in actually watching the 34-year-old isn’t as strong.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>NFL fans split on watching Kaepernick&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Roughly half of NFL fans (51%) said they were either “not too interested” or “not interested at all” in watching Kaepernick if he signed with a franchise, according to the survey.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Self-identified “avid” NFL fans showed more interest than regular fans, with 55% saying they’d be either “very” or “somewhat” interested in watching the quarterback, who has not played in the NFL since Jan. 1, 2017.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Support was divided among political party lines, with only 15% of Republicans saying they were at least somewhat interested in watching Kaepernick. Over half of Democrats (56%) said they were at least somewhat interested in watching him compete again.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Kaepernick had a higher net favorability rating (the share with a favorable opinion minus the share with an unfavorable view) among avid NFL fans (10 percentage points), compared to regular fans of the league (6 points). The former San Francisco 49ers starting quarterback had a net favorability rating of 1 point among self-identified sports fans.</li></ul><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In other NFL offseason news, the league is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>considering alternatives</a> to the Pro Bowl, the annual all-star game that has been criticized for its low intensity and lack of quality play.</p><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Given a list of events that could potentially replace the Pro Bowl, NFL fans expressed the most support for a quarterback skills competition, with 54% saying they were at least somewhat interested in watching the event. About 2 in 5 NFL fans (39%) said they were at least somewhat interested in watching a flag football game between alumni and current players or a dodgeball competition.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Only 3 in 10 NFL fans said they watched February’s Pro Bowl, which drew 6.7 million viewers across ABC and other Walt Disney Co. platforms, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>the game’s lowest audience since 2006</a>. Nearly half of NFL fans (48%) said they’ve watched the game in the past three years.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">In spite of the recent drop-off in interest, over half of NFL fans (55%) and 64% of avid fans said they would watch the Pro Bowl in the future.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The future of the Pro Bowl</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Last month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>admitted</a> what many fans have said for years: The Pro Bowl “doesn’t work.” Now, there are multiple options on the table, including eliminating the game altogether. The survey found that 1 in 3 NFL fans (33%) and 44% of “avid” NFL fans supported removing the game outright —&nbsp;a sign that there’s an appetite for the league to get creative with its annual all-star event.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The survey was conducted June 4-5, 2022, among a representative sample of 2,211 U.S. adults, including 1,387 self-identified NFL fans, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively. The survey also included 613 self-identified “avid” NFL fans, with an unweighted margin of error of 4 percentage points.&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOpJieqJWnu6qvymanqKyVo8GqrctmqZ6spae7brrFpWSpqp9ir7DDyw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./console-pc-gamer-profile.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hardcore Gamers Still Using Consoles Despite PS5 and Xbox Shortages</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gwyneth-paltrow.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gwyneth Paltrow</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
