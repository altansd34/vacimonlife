In such a case, one of the best ways to apologize is through a sweet<a href=#> text message</a>. Here are samples of heart-touching sorry messages for a boyfriend who is mad at you.</p><ul><li>Do you know how great my love for you is? I trembled after realizing that I had made a mistake, and I cried because I fear losing you and want to lose you. Please talk to me.</li><li>I look up to you so much. I look at you with high honour and respect. Since I made a mistake and upset you, I am currently ashamed. I hope you can still give me a chance to change and make it up to you.</li><li>It may be hard for you to understand it right now, but I love you more than humanly possible. You are the best thing that has happened to me, and I am sorry for hurting your feelings. I love you.</li><li>I looked into the eyes of a sensitive, caring man and saw pain. Knowing that I caused it broke my heart. Give me the chance to replace your hurt with the love and joy we once had.</li><li>The only thing I can think right now is how silly I have been. I managed to hurt the feelings of the only person that I love more than everything else in this world.</li><li>Without you, life has no song. I am sorry and hope you will forgive me one day.</li><li>There is no joy in my step, no anticipation in my day. But a tiny flame of hope burns somewhere deep inside, warming me just enough that I continue to pray for your forgiveness.</li><li>My days are filled with anguish and regret because of my folly, and my nights are filled with regrets and wish for the beautiful love we shared. I am ashamed of what I have done.</li><li>I miss you more than you can conceive. I need you more than you can believe. I love you more than you can receive. All I can do is remember and grieve. I made you leave. I am asking for your forgiveness.</li><li>I am the luckiest person on this planet for having a boyfriend like you. But I always cause you some headaches. I promise to become the best person that you can be proud of.</li><li>Life is about the simple things: the way your smile lights up the room and your kiss feels on my cheek. I am sorry, my love, our relationship got complicated. Let us go back to the way it was.</li><li>Forget the past and forgive me for all my mistakes. Let’s make a fresh start with a big cheer on our faces. I am sorry.</li><li>I have complete trust in you, and this is the reason I keep repeating my mistakes. Please forgive me again, I won’t do this ever.</li><li>You are so important to me, and I hate that I made you doubt that. I am so sorry. What can I do to make us OK again?</li><li>Just like you never take me seriously, don’t take my words seriously this time too. Please forgive and forget everything.

When drafting that sorry text for him, ensure that your words come from deep within you and convey what you feel.

Please forget my mistake and forgive me again. I love you a lot.</li><li>For the last few days, I have felt so lonely. I am missing the sweetest hug from my boyfriend. I am missing the nice words while my husband is talking. I am missing the kindest smile of my husband. I am sorry, honey. Please forgive me for my actions that hurt you.</li><li>I strive to be a woman of worth, who keeps her word, a woman of warmth. But I make mistakes.

You paid for my mistake; I deeply regret that. I know I do not deserve this, but please forgive me.</li><li>Ever since we started dating, you have done all I ever asked you to. So, as one last favour, please forgive me so that I can start doing everything you want me to. I am sorry.</li><li>My life is spinning out of control, and I have no one to blame but myself. I need the support and security of your love to get my life together again. Know that I love you and did not mean to hurt you.</li><li>I wish I could tell you how sorry I am for everything I’ve done. I feel like such a loss. You deserve so much better than me, and it kills me inside knowing how I’ve hurt you. The last thing in the world I ever want to do is hurt you, and it kills me to see how much pain I’ve caused you.</li><li>Sorry indeed, seems to be the hardest word. Especially for me. You know I’m just not good at apologizing, but I really feel like I owe you an apology. Please forgive me for what I have said and done. I love you, and I didn’t mean to hurt you.</li><li>Love is not easy. We all make mistakes, and I do that so often that I can’t believe you are still with me. But you are, and I know that’s because you love me. I’m doing my best for you, baby. I am so sorry for hurting you.</li><li>I’m sorry I haven’t been around much lately. I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. You’re the best boyfriend anyone could wish for. I love your sense of humour, your smile, and how caring you are. I love waking up every morning next to you and feeling your arms around me. Thank you for all that you do!</li><li>Being your partner is such a huge privilege for me. I feel the pressure. I promise I’m doing everything to make you feel like the most special person in the world, but sometimes I make mistakes that hurt you. I am really sorry for that.</li><li>I know you are very upset at the moment. But can you just take a moment to think about those good days we had and the sweet memories we shared? Baby, can I remind you of our dreams and what the future holds for us? Please forgive me, darling, I will never make you sad again. Ever.</li><li>Honey, it is clear that you have decided to stay away from me. Baby, you have the right to do this because I’ve disappointed you. But can you give me one more chance and allow me into your heart again? I want to show you how sincerely sorry I am and how desperately I love you.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6fd9d775d2faf04e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Long paragraphs for him to show some love for your partner</span></p></a><h2>How to apologize to your boyfriend for hurting him?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb424acd6887bc5a.png><p class=align-left>A sincere apology has helped couples overcome many challenges.
