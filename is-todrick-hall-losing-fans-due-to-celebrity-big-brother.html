The entertainer has come under fire on the show that puts celebrities in a house with cameras and watches them 24/7 as they compete for the $250,000 grand prize. <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> alum has rubbed his fellow houseguests and fans of the show the wrong way, although he believes he will walk away as a beloved character this season.</strong></p><p>Season 3 of Celebrity Big Brother premiered earlier this month. Since the first episode, the show has seen its share of drama. Six celebrities are left, four were evicted, and one quit. When Hall was first announced as a cast member this season, fans assumed that he would come in and dominate the game. The singer has been vocal about his love for the show.</p><p>At the end of Big Brother Season 23, Hall hosted a huge after party and invited former contestants from the hit show. With a first hand lesson on all things Big Brother, Hall was poised to have an easy ride during Season 3. Unfortunately, the cameras are catching the YouTube star in moments he may look back to regret.</p><p>Live feeds have caught Hall criticizing houseguest Chris Kirkpatrick’s parenting skills and body shaming Shanna Moakler. Hall has been unapologetic about his wealth, which at a time of so many jobs being lost has come off as insensitive. Fans are also confused because Hall has gone on to say how much he needed to win this game for financial reasons. The former Kinky Boots star was even vocal about being the hardest working member in the house.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-the-drag-race-judges-sticking-together>Are the ‘Drag Race’ Judges Sticking Together?</h2><p>Coming into this season fans expected that houseguest Carson Kressley and Hall would be in an alliance together. Forming a trustworthy team is a big part of winning Big Brother. Both celebrities have been an integral part in the success of Rupaul’s Drag Race. It wasn’t long before viewers noticed that the two were not as close as they realized. Each episode shows them more distant than the last, often ending up on opposing sides.</p><p>Season 15 of Rupaul’s Drag Race will certainly be picked up by VH1. It will be interesting to see if Kressley and Hall will share the judges table once again.</p><p>The backlash against Hall is intense. Fans are taking to social media to express their strong feelings. Many are not surprised about the singer’s actions. For years Hall has been ridiculed for his attitude, not paying his dancers, and was accused of predatory behavior.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/TRDD-S1_EP103-AP_4179-2-2-2-2-2.jpg alt="Corbin Bleu, Cat Cora Get Emotional in ‘Real Dirty Dancing’ Heart to Heart" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yKxkraeUp7akt4yhmKWkXaG8tLXNoGSfmZ6oeqXBxGarqGWTmrmmrtGiq7Jlkp60bq7RqKuhnaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julianne-hough-is-joining-the-dwts-live-tour-in-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julianne Hough Is Joining the 'DWTS' Live Tour in 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./investors-chronicle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Investors Chronicle popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
