Our romantic feelings seem an&nbsp;eternal thing for&nbsp;us, and the bond we&nbsp;have with our&nbsp;SO seems unbreakable. Our today’s hero, however, discovered that he&nbsp;easily stopped loving his wife, and it&nbsp;didn’t happen because of&nbsp;her infidelity or&nbsp;some other serious thing. The woman took a&nbsp;break from her kids and went traveling and got back home to&nbsp;find her spouse totally indifferent about her.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started with a&nbsp;7-week vacation the man’s wife took.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/072/990/bec2be51318b50c778af900787.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man, 32, named Peter, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial. He&nbsp;shared his problem with&nbsp;us and was asking our readers for their honest opinion and advice about his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> situation.</p><p>Peter started his letter, saying, “I&nbsp;have been married to&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife Helen, 30, for 4&nbsp;years, and we’ve been together for 9&nbsp;years in&nbsp;total. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom. We&nbsp;have adorable twins, who’re 1,5 years old, which has been incredibly <a href=# title=exhausting data-link=tag>exhausting</a> for my&nbsp;wife.<br>One day, Helen said that she wanted a&nbsp;solo <a href=# title=vacation data-link=tag>vacation</a> break for a&nbsp;few weeks. She explained that she wanted to&nbsp;travel to&nbsp;different states during this break, visit her high school and college friends, go&nbsp;to&nbsp;different shows, and do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun stuff just for herself.”</p><p>Peter was totally understanding and agreed that his wife needed a&nbsp;break. The man wrote, “My&nbsp;wife asked if&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;fine with&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;agreed, but&nbsp;I just asked if&nbsp;she could make it&nbsp;maybe a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks shorter, because 7&nbsp;weeks coping with our 2&nbsp;kids alone sounded really horrifying for&nbsp;me, especially since&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work and it&nbsp;was also my&nbsp;duty. I&nbsp;work remotely, so&nbsp;at&nbsp;least that worked in&nbsp;my&nbsp;favor.”</p><p><h2>Helen left and Peter was managing the kids on&nbsp;his own.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3fa/0b0/683e8c565b8fb367f0e27ac167.jpg><p>Peter goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying, “Helen and&nbsp;I discussed more of&nbsp;this topic for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days, and in&nbsp;the end&nbsp;I ultimately agreed that she did deserve a&nbsp;7-week break because of&nbsp;what she has been through the past few years.”</p><p>Managing 2&nbsp;kids turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not games and fun for the man. He&nbsp;confessed, “And so&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife took her vacation. The first week taking care of&nbsp;our twins alone was extremely difficult, and&nbsp;I did feel like&nbsp;I was losing my&nbsp;mind, but I&nbsp;survived. I&nbsp;asked my&nbsp;older sister to&nbsp;come over and help me&nbsp;from the second week&nbsp;on. My&nbsp;sister was honestly a&nbsp;lifesaver, and I&nbsp;am eternally grateful for her. When she video called me&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the first week, I&nbsp;basically broke down in&nbsp;tears, so&nbsp;this was a&nbsp;sign for her that everything was going on&nbsp;not very well, and she came to&nbsp;the rescue.”</p><p>The man had mixed feelings about the whole situation. He&nbsp;revealed, “So&nbsp;from the second week&nbsp;on, my&nbsp;sister decided to&nbsp;stay over at&nbsp;my&nbsp;house and help me&nbsp;more with my&nbsp;kids. I&nbsp;must confess that a&nbsp;huge burden had been lifted off my&nbsp;shoulders. I&nbsp;was able at&nbsp;least to&nbsp;focus more on&nbsp;my&nbsp;urgent work, and&nbsp;I did meet my&nbsp;deadlines.<br>To&nbsp;be&nbsp;brutally honest, I&nbsp;did not miss Helen at&nbsp;all. I&nbsp;felt emotionally and mentally relaxed. I&nbsp;should say, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun with my&nbsp;babies and my&nbsp;sister. I&nbsp;felt betrayed because my&nbsp;wife had actually gone on&nbsp;that 7-week vacation and left me&nbsp;alone. I&nbsp;was slowly falling out of&nbsp;love with my&nbsp;wife.”</p><p><h2>Helen came back home to&nbsp;find her husband being totally indifferent to&nbsp;her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d8/c42/cffa72506a82ffd399419151c0.jpg><p>Peter goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying, “Helen did call multiple times while she was on&nbsp;that vacation, and she tried to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;a&nbsp;plenty of&nbsp;advice about the kids. But this all seemed so&nbsp;wrong to&nbsp;me, especially when&nbsp;I looked through her Instagram posts, where she posted her happy selfies at&nbsp;different parties, concerts and dining out with her friends. The contrast between her life and mine was striking.”</p><p>So, when the woman finally came back home, Peter was behaving like an&nbsp;absolute stranger. The man confessed, “When Helen was back from her 7-week break, she was super refreshed and recharged, but to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest&nbsp;I was exhausted and indifferent to&nbsp;her. She was trying to&nbsp;hug and kiss me&nbsp;when she came back, which&nbsp;I rejected because&nbsp;I said&nbsp;I wasn’t feeling&nbsp;it. The same level of&nbsp;indifference remained in&nbsp;our day-to-day life, and she probably noticed it&nbsp;but didn’t say anything.”</p><p>Things went too far after some time. Peter revealed, “Two weeks later, Helen finally asked me&nbsp;why&nbsp;I was like this, and&nbsp;I honestly told her&nbsp;I didn’t love her anymore. She apologized profusely for taking that 7-week vacation, and asked if&nbsp;there was anything she could do&nbsp;to&nbsp;fix&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;immediately told her&nbsp;no. We&nbsp;went through some severe motions the next couple of&nbsp;weeks, before&nbsp;I finally decided that&nbsp;I wanted a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>.”</p><p><h2>Peter’s decision was tough, but the man insisted on&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/461/371/e84cbf53d084690ef4659a446d.jpg><p>The man wrote, “My&nbsp;wife seemed devastated when&nbsp;I brought up&nbsp;the very topic of&nbsp;divorce. Her reaction surprised me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I already told her&nbsp;I don’t love her anymore. She did try to&nbsp;initiate our visits to&nbsp;couples’ therapy or&nbsp;marriage counseling. But I&nbsp;already started looking for a&nbsp;divorce lawyer, and&nbsp;I honestly didn’t feel that there was something that could help our family not to&nbsp;fall apart.”</p><p>Peter added, “I&nbsp;spent some time thinking about everything, and I&nbsp;am still sure&nbsp;I want a&nbsp;divorce. I&nbsp;basically don’t love my&nbsp;wife anymore, and I’m sure&nbsp;I won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;start loving her again. At&nbsp;this point, I&nbsp;don’t believe that any marriage counseling could fix&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Peter closed his letter, saying, “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;clarify one thing. Money was not an&nbsp;issue at&nbsp;all. I&nbsp;do have a&nbsp;high paying, though a&nbsp;very stressful job. It&nbsp;didn’t bother me&nbsp;how much money Helen spent on&nbsp;her trip.<br>The main issue was that&nbsp;I was mentally overwhelmed coping with 2&nbsp;small kids while&nbsp;I was also working full-time. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the first week, I&nbsp;had lost my&nbsp;sanity and even broke down in&nbsp;tears when my&nbsp;sister video called&nbsp;me, and Helen did feel my&nbsp;mental state at&nbsp;that time, but it&nbsp;never gave her a&nbsp;clue that she must give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;her vacation and come back home to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with me&nbsp;in&nbsp;these hard times.”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;mind-boggling story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose husband ruined their marriage by&nbsp;asking her to&nbsp;serve him bigger portions of&nbsp;food for lunch. <a href=#>Read more</a> to&nbsp;find out why this has become such a&nbsp;huge problem for our heroine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZur86mp6WdpJq5unnFnqOlZZ%2BqwW67xWajqK6VYsSqwMdmpLJlp56zpnnAn6ueql2otaZ506impGWRYoRuw8SeomaukZiutbXOp2RxaWhrf3Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1445363-jatavia-shakara-johnsons-biography-age-height-parents-baby.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jatavia Shakara Johnsons biography: age, height, parents, baby</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1467494-how-break-partner-fell-love-person.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to break-up with your partner because you fell in love with another person</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
