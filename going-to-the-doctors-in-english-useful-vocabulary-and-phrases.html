Feeling sick is never fun, but when you’re away from home and you have to go to a doctor and speak in a different language, it can be much more stressful. Here we’re going to have a look at what it’s like to go to the doctor’s in the UK and how you can explain how you’re feeling.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Doctors and surgeries</strong></h3><p>When you hear someone say, “I’m going to the doctor’s” in English, they almost always mean they are going to see their <strong>GP</strong>. A GP is a <strong>General Practitioner </strong>and is the first point of contact if you’re feeling unwell. They can refer you to a <strong>specialist</strong> if they think it’s necessary. The place you go is called a <strong>surgery</strong> or a <strong>practice</strong> – they mean the same thing, and we can think of them as a doctor’s office. Most practices in the UK also have a <strong>practice nurse </strong>who provides care alongside the doctor.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Registering for a GP in the UK</strong></h3><p>If you move to the UK, you should <strong>register</strong> with a GP. You should choose a practice in your local area, but you have the right to choose your GP based on your needs. The easiest way to register is to go to the practice and <strong>fill in</strong> a <strong>registration form</strong>. You don’t need to show your ID, but it will be helpful if you have it. It’s free to register with a GP.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Your appointment</strong> at the doctor’s</h3><p>The first thing you have to do if you want to go to the doctor’s is make an <strong>appointment</strong>. You can do that by calling or using a website or an application; you will be able to choose a time and day that is convenient for you. When you go to the doctor’s, you will wait in the <strong>waiting room</strong>. The doctor will call you through to their office, ask you about your <strong>symptoms </strong>and about any<strong> allergies</strong> you have. Then, they make a <strong>diagnosis</strong> if they can. If you need some<strong> medicine</strong>, they will write you a <strong>prescription</strong> and tell you the <strong>dose</strong> you should take, for example, one tablet every 4 hours. You can take that prescription to a <strong>chemist</strong> and they will <strong>fill it</strong> – give you the medicine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Common symptoms</strong> in English</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Aches</strong></h3><p>An ache is a continuous pain, which is not very strong. We use the word together with certain body parts, the most common ones are: <strong>stomach ache</strong>, <strong>headache</strong>, <strong>earache </strong>and <strong>backache</strong>. <strong>Toothache</strong> is also common, but if you have toothache you need a dentist, not a doctor! Check the pronunciation on the word ache – it’s a funny one.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Other common symptoms</strong></h3><p>If your throat hurts, you can say that you have a <strong>sore throat</strong>. If you are sneezing and your nose is blocked, you might have <strong>a cold</strong>. Having a <strong>temperature</strong> means that your body temperature is higher than normal, and a <strong>fever</strong> means your temperature is quite a bit higher than normal. If you have a <strong>cough</strong>, a fever and a sore throat, you might have <strong>flu</strong>. Some people also <strong>vomit</strong> when they have flu, but vomiting can be caused by lots of different things. You might also go to the doctor if you have a <strong>rash</strong> – usually a lot of small red spots on your skin. If your rash is <strong>itchy</strong>, the doctor will prescribe some cream.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conversations with a GP</strong> in English</h3><p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Good morning, Tom. How are you feeling today?</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>: Terrible! I’ve got a fever and a bad headache.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Doctor</strong>: I’m going to take your temperature… oh yes, it is a bit high. Have you had any vomiting?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tom</strong>: No, thankfully. But I’ve got a blocked nose. Is it flu?!</p><p><strong>Doctor</strong>: I don’t think it’s flu. I think it’s just a bad cold. I prescribe bed rest and some paracetamol. Come back if you’re not feeling better in a couple of days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Jane, what brings you here today?</p><p><strong>Jane</strong>: I’ve got earache – it really is quite painful. I’ve had it for 4 days now.</p><p><strong>Doctor</strong>: I’m just going to look inside your ear… Ah, it looks like an infection – 4 days is a long time. Is there anything else bothering you?</p><p><strong>Jane</strong>: I’ve got a bit of a sore throat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Let me have a look. Open wide! Well poor you, Jane. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. Twice a day for 5 days and you should feel better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jane</strong>: Thank you so much! I’ll go to the chemist now.</p><p>Now you’re ready to go book an appointment. Don’t be scared – remember health professionals are there to help you!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
