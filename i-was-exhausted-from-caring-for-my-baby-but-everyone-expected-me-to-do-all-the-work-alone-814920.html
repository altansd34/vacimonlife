It&nbsp;was about a&nbsp;husband who wanted to&nbsp;bathe the <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a> in&nbsp;the evening and asked his wife to&nbsp;load the <a href=# title=dishwasher data-link=tag>dishwasher</a> while he&nbsp;did&nbsp;so. She refused, saying that she needed some rest. He&nbsp;was puzzled and said, “I&nbsp;thought spending time with the baby was your rest.” And&nbsp;I, like hundreds of&nbsp;other commenters, felt a&nbsp;sting from his remark.</p><p>The story, which the author intended as&nbsp;a&nbsp;joke, sparked a&nbsp;serious debate. That’s because the topic is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;humorous one. Women are fed up&nbsp;with having to&nbsp;explain why maternity leave, despite being called a&nbsp;<a href=# title=vacation data-link=tag>vacation</a>, is&nbsp;not one, why taking care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;leisure activity, but a&nbsp;full-time job.</p><p>And they also face double standards every time: if&nbsp;a&nbsp;man spends time with his child, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;heroic act, but the wife, who does it&nbsp;every day, is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;have it&nbsp;easy. As&nbsp;one commenter put&nbsp;it, “If&nbsp;time with the baby is&nbsp;rest time, then let the husband, who is&nbsp;so&nbsp;rested after bathing the baby, load the dishwasher afterwards.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f99/117/91ec5350629fa4786b606723d0.jpg><p>I&nbsp;have <a href=#>experienced</a> parenting first-hand, and&nbsp;I have also observed others. I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;first child relatively late, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;27, and&nbsp;I thought long and hard before deciding to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mom. I&nbsp;knew myself well&nbsp;— I&nbsp;could not stand discomfort. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;did not sleep or&nbsp;rest well, I&nbsp;would become irritable and moody. I&nbsp;would lose my&nbsp;temper, get angry, sulk and pout, and try to&nbsp;restrain myself from snapping at&nbsp;others.</p><p>This is&nbsp;what&nbsp;I discussed with my&nbsp;husband, asking him: “I&nbsp;will go&nbsp;crazy from lack of&nbsp;sleep, from not being able to&nbsp;eat properly and relax in&nbsp;the bath with a&nbsp;book. A&nbsp;baby is&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant source of&nbsp;stress. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;fair for a&nbsp;baby to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;unstable mom? What did he&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;deserve that?”</p><p>Well, I&nbsp;was not in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry, I&nbsp;was not ready yet. And in&nbsp;general, I&nbsp;think that every woman should seriously consider whether she is&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;give birth, because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;few years of&nbsp;living on&nbsp;the edge. I&nbsp;was not up&nbsp;for that, but my&nbsp;husband and relatives convinced&nbsp;me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f3/8d9/16f3d857d483e7174bd3a15708.jpg><p>I&nbsp;don’t know what to&nbsp;say... My&nbsp;husband’s parents, who begged me&nbsp;to&nbsp;give them grandchildren, never even bothered to&nbsp;take the baby for a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;the stroller. They just came over for tea and cake and gave me&nbsp;useless advice.</p><p>My&nbsp;mother-in-law would hold her grandson for ten minutes, and then she was done&nbsp;— she was exhausted. My&nbsp;father-in-law avoided him like the plague&nbsp;— he&nbsp;is&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;babies, apparently. When my&nbsp;grandson grows&nbsp;up, then maybe...</p><p>And my&nbsp;husband? Whenever I&nbsp;asked him to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;out a&nbsp;bit, or&nbsp;complained about how tired I&nbsp;was, he&nbsp;would say, “You’re a&nbsp;mother! How can you be&nbsp;tired of&nbsp;your own child?”</p><p>And he&nbsp;couldn’t help anyway. He&nbsp;had been to&nbsp;the gym the day before, and he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;rest his muscles. But for&nbsp;me, who lugs around a&nbsp;chubby baby all day long, physical exercise should be&nbsp;good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/927/fd0/20072b51f28b7caa0a96f94972.jpg><p>I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother-in-law: maybe you could talk to&nbsp;him, make him understand. But she said, “Do&nbsp;you expect him to&nbsp;come home from work and start doing chores? He&nbsp;earns money&nbsp;— he&nbsp;deserves to&nbsp;rest, and you are just playing with the child.”</p><p>And before&nbsp;I could say anything, she added, “You’re selfish. You resent your husband&nbsp;— a&nbsp;grown man of&nbsp;30&nbsp;for going to&nbsp;the gym and fishing with his friends. Why should he&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;home if&nbsp;you can’t manage the household? You chose to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby&nbsp;— deal with it&nbsp;yourself.”</p><p>When I&nbsp;confided in&nbsp;my&nbsp;own mother that my&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;not willing to&nbsp;watch our son to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the pool once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while, instead of&nbsp;words of&nbsp;support I&nbsp;heard, “You’re spoiled, living in&nbsp;the big city! He&nbsp;brings money, he&nbsp;doesn’t cheat&nbsp;— what more do&nbsp;you want? Do&nbsp;you know what kind of&nbsp;jerks we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;deal with here? Do&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;end up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;divorced single mom?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96f/3d0/a203a05d9c8e786756c51b98ea.jpg><p>I&nbsp;thought a&nbsp;married friend who <a href=#>has</a> two older toddlers would understand me&nbsp;better and give me&nbsp;some advice. She told&nbsp;me, “Men are not really interested in&nbsp;babies. Think about&nbsp;it, what can they do&nbsp;with them? They don’t know how to&nbsp;play with toys, how to&nbsp;stimulate their development, how to&nbsp;dress them or&nbsp;feed them properly.</p><p>So&nbsp;the baby cries, and the husband doesn’t know what’s wrong. Mine was the same with the little ones, he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;deal with them, but now they can go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the movies together, ride bikes, and&nbsp;I can relax.”</p><p>What a&nbsp;lame excuse&nbsp;— “not interested”. As&nbsp;if&nbsp;women have a&nbsp;special mechanism in&nbsp;nature that makes&nbsp;us love all kinds of&nbsp;cuddling and changing diapers. And we&nbsp;go&nbsp;into ecstasy when we&nbsp;purée a&nbsp;zucchini and then get it&nbsp;spat at&nbsp;us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b51/b2f/37c8e15a77be2eeb7c8e11ff1b.jpg><p>We&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;getting divorced. Because I&nbsp;was exhausted by&nbsp;his attitude, and our marriage fell apart. My&nbsp;husband started to&nbsp;imply that&nbsp;I had changed for the worse: we&nbsp;used to&nbsp;exercise together, and we&nbsp;always had something to&nbsp;talk about.</p><p>He&nbsp;said&nbsp;I was not growing, that all my&nbsp;interests revolved around the child. He&nbsp;also said&nbsp;I had let myself&nbsp;go, and that&nbsp;I should lose some weight&nbsp;— it&nbsp;had been a&nbsp;long time since&nbsp;I gave birth. He&nbsp;said&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;beautiful and smart, but now&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;mess.</p><p>He&nbsp;even pointed out a&nbsp;woman he&nbsp;saw on&nbsp;social media&nbsp;— she had three children, and she was gorgeous and managed everything. That’s when&nbsp;I finally snapped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40f/685/df9cd256a8b4d7ee71c4eb2d76.jpg><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years later, I&nbsp;got married for the second time, and my&nbsp;beloved husband started talking about having a&nbsp;child. He&nbsp;also promised to&nbsp;help. And I&nbsp;was already over&nbsp;30, my&nbsp;son had just finished primary school, he&nbsp;was almost independent. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;that nightmare!</p><p>I&nbsp;came home from the maternity hospital. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;stood over the crib, I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;husband, “I&nbsp;gave birth to&nbsp;this baby, but remember, he&nbsp;should not interfere with my&nbsp;life.” He&nbsp;laughed and asked, “What will you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;does? Will you push him back&nbsp;in?” I&nbsp;calmly replied, “No, I’ll just leave you. Either we&nbsp;are both parents, or&nbsp;you are not my&nbsp;partner but a&nbsp;burden that needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken care&nbsp;of.”</p><p>And my&nbsp;wonderful husband started to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;he&nbsp;could. But not everyone accepted his behavior. My&nbsp;new mother-in-law began to&nbsp;wring her hands and shriek, “How could you leave your husband alone with a&nbsp;baby in&nbsp;his arms? Why do&nbsp;you need a&nbsp;manicure? You are staying at&nbsp;home&nbsp;— who will see your hands?”</p><p>I&nbsp;didn’t apologize, but sarcastically asked, “Do&nbsp;you think your own son is&nbsp;an&nbsp;idiot? So&nbsp;I&nbsp;can figure out which end to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;diaper, and where to&nbsp;breastfeed, but he&nbsp;can’t?” She, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion, gritted her teeth in&nbsp;anger, but couldn’t think of&nbsp;what to&nbsp;say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08a/a9a/d21c5f592ba06a31fba86abaed.jpg><p>But my&nbsp;own mom really upset me&nbsp;again. I&nbsp;was chatting with her on&nbsp;the video call, and&nbsp;I was getting ready to&nbsp;meet my&nbsp;friends. I&nbsp;told her that today&nbsp;I would leave the kids with my&nbsp;husband for the night&nbsp;— the girls and&nbsp;I were going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;spa center out of&nbsp;town.</p><p>I&nbsp;was joking, saying it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;relax and pamper myself. And she said, “What kind of&nbsp;mother are you if&nbsp;you abandon your children? You’ll push your wonderful husband away. He&nbsp;married you, a&nbsp;divorced woman with a&nbsp;kid, and what are you doing?”</p><p>My&nbsp;old friend didn’t understand me&nbsp;either. She said, “If&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;rest so&nbsp;much, then take the kids, go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the sea and have a&nbsp;vacation. How can you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;resort without them?” That’s when&nbsp;I actually cried.</p><p>She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom herself, but she doesn’t realize that a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;a&nbsp;job, and you need to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break from work sometimes, not drag it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the beach with you. And she knows that my&nbsp;kids see the sea often, and my&nbsp;husband can have a&nbsp;great time on&nbsp;his own&nbsp;— he&nbsp;loves skiing, and I’m not into it&nbsp;anymore. She knows, and still, she judges&nbsp;me. She thinks it’s not appropriate for a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;act like that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7c/e9d/5243d95cc49b01dcc855ab0c82.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems that not only the older generation has the belief stuck in&nbsp;their heads that childcare is&nbsp;not much work. As&nbsp;if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;law of&nbsp;nature: a&nbsp;mother cannot get tired of&nbsp;her child&nbsp;— he&nbsp;is&nbsp;her flesh and blood. It&nbsp;seems that she has nothing to&nbsp;rest from. And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;unthinkable to&nbsp;<a href=#>leave</a> the father with the children.</p><p>The man can go&nbsp;away somewhere for a&nbsp;week, and the woman alone will manage, but if&nbsp;the wife leaves for the same period&nbsp;— it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;disaster. Dad can’t handle what mom can easily handle. You don’t help your wife&nbsp;— it’s fine, everyone excuses you; you help&nbsp;— you are a&nbsp;hero, but your wife is&nbsp;to&nbsp;blame, and her mother is&nbsp;not good enough.</p><p>And the fact that a&nbsp;woman, when she takes care of&nbsp;the household and the child, burns out, loses interest in&nbsp;herself and her husband&nbsp;— that’s a&nbsp;minor issue. But I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like that. And I&nbsp;don’t care what all the gossips of&nbsp;the world say about me&nbsp;— I&nbsp;also have the right to&nbsp;rest. And it’s not the time&nbsp;I spend with my&nbsp;kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuw8CsZJ6wmJbCtMDEnWSfqp%2BieqSt0aKloGWWpL9uudhmmZqaqWKvtsCMnq2eqqmku6Z5xLGnnpukmrFuucRmq6hllKR6orjLZquhnV2svLO3jJqjqKaVYoVygJhrZ2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./im-a-lazy-stay-at-home-mom-who-hates-cleaning-i-couldnt-care-less-that-my-house-is-a-mess-816366.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Im a Lazy Stay-at-Home Mom Who Hates Cleaning I Couldnt Care Less That My House Is a Mess</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-be-optimistic-english.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to be Optimistic in English | Lingoda</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
