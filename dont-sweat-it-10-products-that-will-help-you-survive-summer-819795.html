Check out our ultimate survival kit to keep you cool, calm, and collected. Now let's get to these must-have products designed to help you enjoy every moment of the season.</p><h2>1. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>water-resistant SPF 50+ sunscreen stick</a> clearly works. Just one catch, though: you have to apply it evenly for the desired effect. The product is a popular choice for sun protection due to its lightweight, non-greasy formula.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f61/f55/ee0be6536a921547a13f7d5374.jpg><p>This sunscreen offers protection against both UVA and UVB rays.

I was not careful with the application technique, so I obviously missed spots, as seen in the photo. It works really well, as seen in the pale areas on my arms. The missed areas are the red areas and where my swimsuit was.</i><br><i>While this experience will make for some silly tan lines, the product itself works well if you are careful. I was in the water 20 minutes after application, so it works fast in my opinion. - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lucky3</i></a></li></ul><h2>2. Use these <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cooling towels</a> to keep you cool and comfy during intense workouts or hot days.

I gave one to each of the girls I went with. They worked really well and kept us cool in the 100+ degree heat.</i><br><i>I ended up tying mine around my head, similar to a headband. It kept the sweat off my face and kept me cool! I thought I'd only use mine for the festival, but I've actually kept it to use in my garden as well. It's also helpful while mowing! - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Kayla</i></a></li></ul><h2>3.

Use this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cooling bandana</a> to help your four-legged friend stay comfortable during hot summer days.

Living in TX, it's hard to find something for her to wear and stay cool during the summer heat.

See when you need to reapply sunscreen with this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>innovative solution</a>. These stickers ensure effective sunscreen application and reapplication.

I put on 30 SPF before going outside and didn’t notice any change. Then, my friend put on 50 SPF, and the sticker was totally clear once we got into the sun! Mine faded a good bit, but clearly a lower SPF means less protection.</i><br><i>It was a great indicator of when we needed to reapply and how much protection we were actually getting! - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Amazon Customer</i></a></li></ul><h2>6.

I used them on a trip to Acadia National Park in Maine. Several of the hikes were swarming with mosquitoes, flies, and bees. As soon as our family put them on our wrists, boom, no more mosquitoes!!!! Again, I was very skeptical and so pleasantly surprised!</i><br><i>They smell like citronella, so if you don’t like that smell, you likely will not like the smell of these. They didn’t bother me or my family. I have very small wrists, as does my son, and they fit us just fine. They did fit pretty loose on my son’s wrist, so he just put it on above his watch, and it stayed on just fine.</i><br><i>So, it fits all varying wrist sizes. And they are very stretchy. However, they will stretch out. Overall, I am very pleased with this product! - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Amazon Customer</i></a></li></ul><h2>8.
