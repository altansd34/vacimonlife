In&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;her 77th birthday, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;uncover some interesting facts we&nbsp;found out about her private life and career.</p><p><h2>She’s a&nbsp;skin cancer survivor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce7/fbd/1123e75cf8b76100a76c37add7.jpg><p>NPA/The Grosby Group/EAST NEWS</p><p>Keaton was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma at&nbsp;age 21&nbsp;and not long ago, she had her second squamous cell cancer removed from the area surrounding her left ear. Sadly, skin cancer runs in&nbsp;her family and her aunt, father, and brother also had&nbsp;it. That’s why she can never be&nbsp;found without sunscreen in&nbsp;her pocket, and she makes sure she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>applies</a> it&nbsp;daily. Her hats, which are part of&nbsp;her unique style, also help her protect her face from the sun.</p><p>“Back in&nbsp;my&nbsp;20s, I&nbsp;didn’t pay attention much,” Keaton revealed about taking care of&nbsp;her skin. “I&nbsp;didn’t research and didn’t really care, and that was stupid because it’s dogged me&nbsp;my&nbsp;entire adult life, even recently. I&nbsp;didn’t start sun care until my&nbsp;40s.”<br></p><p><h2>She was born as&nbsp;Diane Hall, not Diane Keaton.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e9/432/f58d475146ae289f35d17ff244.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News</p><p>Diane changed her name to&nbsp;Keaton (her mother’s maiden name) when she found out that there was already an&nbsp;actress registered under the name of&nbsp;Diane Hall when she joined the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Actors’ Equity Association</a>.</p><p>That’s why the movie, that is&nbsp;loosely based on&nbsp;the real-life romance that occurred between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, is&nbsp;called Annie Hall. Annie was her nickname when she was younger, and Hall is&nbsp;her real <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surname</a>.</p><p><h2>Keaton has suffered from asthma and other breathing related problems since she was a&nbsp;young girl.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b87/87a/c42eb15a28a796395fe17fbda4.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News</p><p>People with <a href=# title=asthma data-link=tag>asthma</a> can lead full, joyful lives today, but back in&nbsp;the 1950s, when treatment options were limited, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit harder to&nbsp;handle the condition. Diane still remembers when she experienced a&nbsp;life-threatening bout with whooping cough when she was in&nbsp;4th grade, and how her father had to&nbsp;hold her upside down, so&nbsp;she could catch a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>breath</a>.</p><p>“I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I was dying. I&nbsp;couldn’t breathe. Asthma was bad enough, but this whooping cough thing was way worse,” she wrote. “When dad turned me&nbsp;upside down, I&nbsp;got my&nbsp;breath back almost instantaneously. It&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;miracle. Mom was worried, she kept me&nbsp;out of&nbsp;school for 2&nbsp;months,” revealed Keaton.</p><p><h2>Diane Keaton’s iconic, eccentric style still influences fashion trends today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d0/c4c/004fd650b394681ed194fd7ffe.jpg><p>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Diane became a&nbsp;fashion icon after playing the role of&nbsp;the menswear-clad Annie Hall in&nbsp;the 1977 movie of&nbsp;the same name. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>embodied</a> what a&nbsp;fashionable <a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> woman should wear and since then Keaton developed a&nbsp;timeless, unique style filled with tailored pieces, skirts and dresses, wide belts, layers, hats, wide-legged trousers, and neutral tones.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, Keaton’s distinguishing look represents freedom. She is&nbsp;sometimes referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;the “fairy godmother of&nbsp;fearless style” as&nbsp;she plays with bold appearances that are only motivated by&nbsp;her personal preferences and have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with what other people may think.</p><p><h2>She became a&nbsp;single mom at&nbsp;50.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b12/f68/de2133520fbb10dd5d0448349d.jpg><p>AP/East News</p><p>Diane’s maternal instinct kicked in&nbsp;later in&nbsp;life. In&nbsp;1996, at&nbsp;age&nbsp;50, she adopted her daughter Dexter, and 5&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;2001, she adopted her son Duke. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, she said that motherhood is&nbsp;the most humbling experience she’s ever had, and it&nbsp;made her a&nbsp;better person.</p><p>However, even though she was happily single back when she adopted her children, she revealed that it&nbsp;would’ve been better if&nbsp;she had someone by&nbsp;her side. “As&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, I&nbsp;provide all I&nbsp;can, but&nbsp;I think in&nbsp;the best possible scenario, you need to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;man,” Keaton said, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opening</a>&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>She said no&nbsp;to&nbsp;plastic surgery.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/561/af6/e458155f5a9d2d4258e379c4f2.jpg><p>Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Although Diane has not had any <a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a> so&nbsp;far, she has not ruled out the possibility of&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;in&nbsp;the future, because in&nbsp;the past she said she would never do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things, like going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychiatrist, but she did it&nbsp;anyway and was glad she took the leap <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>afterward</a>.</p><p>However, she’s still not fond of&nbsp;plastic surgery. “My&nbsp;feeling is&nbsp;that everybody has their hands and their hands are always around their face, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;the hands don’t match the face, it’s a&nbsp;little weird. My&nbsp;hands are the hands of&nbsp;the age I&nbsp;am. They’ve been through a&nbsp;lot, and they look like&nbsp;it!” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p><h2>She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;vegetarian.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/338/42c/4aa9b456a1afc0b8c1319f47cb.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Keaton has been a&nbsp;vegetarian for 27&nbsp;years now.
