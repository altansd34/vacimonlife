From her beehive hairstyle to&nbsp;her bold eyeliner and tattoos, Amy’s distinct look was as&nbsp;iconic. Her unique voice and raw, emotionally charged lyrics set her apart from her contemporaries and made her a&nbsp;standout in&nbsp;the music industry.</p><p><h2>She started as&nbsp;a&nbsp;journalist and didn’t expect to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;popular singer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32b/050/5588fc55b3833864554410b39a.jpg><p>Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS</p><p>Amy Winehouse was a&nbsp;truly remarkable talent, possessing a&nbsp;unique ability to&nbsp;pull off a&nbsp;style that few could imitate. Even John <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Waters</a>, the famed filmmaker and <strong>cultural icon</strong>, marveled at&nbsp;Winehouse’s ability to&nbsp;“look that cheap and pull it&nbsp;off.”</p><p>Despite her struggles with personal demons, Winehouse’s talent as&nbsp;a&nbsp;musician was undeniable. Many believed that she possessed an&nbsp;abundance of&nbsp;gifts, perhaps even more than she knew how to&nbsp;use. Her music was raw, emotional, and deeply personal, resonating with audiences around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afc/967/c4e23a50a4801feace147d3517.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS</p><p>Amy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Winehouse</a> was born in&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> in&nbsp;1983<strong> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family with a&nbsp;love of&nbsp;music</strong>. Her father, Mitch Winehouse, was a&nbsp;window panel installer who loved jazz, and her mother, Janis Winehouse, worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pharmacist. From a&nbsp;young age, Amy showed a&nbsp;passion for music and began singing in&nbsp;her local choir. She was also influenced by&nbsp;her relatives’ love of&nbsp;jazz and soul music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80b/c21/b419375857b4de77ace1c7baff.jpg><p>Despite her early interest in&nbsp;music, Amy’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>path</a> to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;singer was not a&nbsp;straight one. After leaving school, she worked as&nbsp;an&nbsp;entertainment journalist. Then Winehouse’s best friend, soul singer Tyler James, <strong>sent her demo tape to&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who was working for a&nbsp;music label</strong>.</p><p>In&nbsp;2003, she released her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debut</a> album, “Frank,” which was a&nbsp;critical success and her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> went&nbsp;up.<br>But it&nbsp;was her second album, “Back to&nbsp;Black,” that truly catapulted Amy to&nbsp;stardom and made her internationally popular. The album, which was released in&nbsp;2006, showcased Amy’s distinctive voice and emotionally charged lyrics.</p><p><h2>Her famous tattoo has a&nbsp;meaning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a1/5b8/3859ed510ca7350874953be354.jpg><p>AXELLE/BAUER-GRIFFIN.COM/East News</p><p>Amy Winehouse was not only a&nbsp;talented musician, but she was also known for her love of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tattoos</a>. One of&nbsp;her most famous tattoos was an&nbsp;arm piece featuring a&nbsp;pin-up girl surrounded by&nbsp;hearts and the name “<strong>Cynthia</strong>.” This tattoo was a&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;her <strong>grandmother </strong>and was designed in&nbsp;collaboration with tattoo artist Henry Hate. Although it&nbsp;was meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;crude design, it&nbsp;became one of&nbsp;the most recognizable tattoo designs in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Birmingham Mail, Hate receives occasional requests to&nbsp;replicate the tattoo, but he&nbsp;always refuses out of&nbsp;respect for Amy Winehouse and the original meaning behind the design. This tattoo serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;the strong bond between Amy and her grandmother, and it&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;inspire fans and tattoo enthusiasts around the world.</p><p><h2>She really tried to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rehab.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/475/87d/48107b5beaab043e52866ba71d.jpg><p>BIGPICTURESPHOTO.COM/EAST NEWS</p><p>Amy Winehouse’s hit song “Rehab” is&nbsp;known for its rebellious lyrics, with the chorus stating, “<strong>They tried to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;rehab, I&nbsp;said&nbsp;no, no, no</strong>.” The song was inspired by&nbsp;a&nbsp;real-life incident in&nbsp;which someone close to&nbsp;the singer suggested she seek residential rehabilitation for her struggles with addiction.</p><p>In&nbsp;early 2005, Amy Winehouse’s personal struggles began to&nbsp;intensify as&nbsp;her grandmother’s health declined. Along with her longstanding battle with bulimia and addictions, the situation was made worse with her tumultuous relationship with her on-again, off-again <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>boyfriend</a>, Blake Fielder-Civil. In&nbsp;2008, Winehouse went into rehab, but it&nbsp;didn’t help her mental health and in&nbsp;the same year she was arrested twice.</p><p><h2>Her relationship were both a&nbsp;trauma and inspiration for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/494/1d1/e3f2d15f58934082aeb2ab493e.jpg><p>Michael Germana/Everett Collection / East News</p><p>Amy Winehouse and Blake Fielder-Civil’s intense <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romance</a> was marked by&nbsp;grand gestures, including tattoos of&nbsp;each other’s names. Amy had<strong> “Blake” tattooed on&nbsp;her chest</strong>, while he&nbsp;got her name inked behind his ear. However, after just six months, their relationship came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;abrupt end when Fielder-Civil left her for his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Despite their tumultuous relationship, Fielder-Civil remained an&nbsp;important figure in&nbsp;Amy’s life and music. Many of&nbsp;her songs, including the hit single “Back to&nbsp;Black,” were inspired by&nbsp;their volatile <a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a> and subsequent breakups. The intense emotions and raw honesty of&nbsp;her music made her a&nbsp;beloved and influential artist.</p><p>Amy’s career was cut short when she passed away in&nbsp;2011&nbsp;at the age of&nbsp;27. But her influence on&nbsp;the music industry and her fans continues to&nbsp;this day.
