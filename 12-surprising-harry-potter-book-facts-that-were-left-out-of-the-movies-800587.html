That was either due to&nbsp;the lengthy content of&nbsp;the books or&nbsp;because producers couldn’t anticipate what the next novels would be&nbsp;about. One of&nbsp;the missing facts is&nbsp;that Harry could have easily been replaced as&nbsp;the chosen one and this probably would have opened up&nbsp;our imagination even more.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> chose the missing facts from the movies that we&nbsp;think might make you think twice once you learn about them.</p><p><h2>1. Harry didn’t break the elder wand.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c5a/61b/f754bf51079bf4fb60bed89068.jpg><p>The Elder wand was a&nbsp;<a href=#>magnet</a> for trouble. Its purpose was to&nbsp;make its owner unbeatable. So, Harry knew that whoever had&nbsp;it (that people knew about&nbsp;it), was a&nbsp;target. He&nbsp;was tired of&nbsp;fighting and also he&nbsp;was the only one who could destroy&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;broke the wand into 2&nbsp;pieces in&nbsp;the movie.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;the book, Harry doesn’t break the wand. Instead, he&nbsp;returns it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dumbledore’s tomb, but before he&nbsp;does he&nbsp;repairs his own wand with&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>2. Professor Trelawney actually dropped crystal balls on&nbsp;the Death Eaters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb9/355/67a9805d72975d49d041e3e9dc.jpg><p>Professor Trelawney also participated during the Battle of&nbsp;Hogwarts. However, the part where she was dropping crystal balls on&nbsp;enemies’ heads was cut out of&nbsp;the movie. She actually knocked out Fenrir Greyback as&nbsp;he&nbsp;attacked Lavender Brown.</p><p>Even though she wasn’t <a href=#>successfu</a><a href=#>l</a> at&nbsp;saving Lavender, she continued throwing crystal balls with a&nbsp;“tennis-like serve” onto the heads of&nbsp;the Death Eaters.</p><p><h2>3. Harry Potter’s first broom wasn’t a&nbsp;Nimbus 2000.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/482/c04/4c04ac5233a0f52e98e7f8fa5f.png><p>One important detail that viewers don’t know and that readers might have missed is&nbsp;that actually that the Nimbus 2000 wasn’t Harry’s first broomstick. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;letter that was written by&nbsp;his mother, Lily, she tells Sirius that Harry enjoys the toy broomstick that he&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;him. She then explains how <a href=#>Harry</a> has been flying all around the garden and that James thinks he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent Quidditch player.</p><p><h2>4. Peeves was left out of&nbsp;the movies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/364/4d2/565b7d5518a64046ebc6640dec.jpg><p>Hogwarts School is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=#>ghosts</a>, each schoolhouse even has its own. However, there is&nbsp;one figure that wasn’t part of&nbsp;the movies: Peeves, the naughtiest of&nbsp;them all. Actually, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;ghost, but a&nbsp;poltergeist.</p><p>He&nbsp;spends his time causing trouble by&nbsp;mocking students and even splatters visitors with mud. He&nbsp;even proves very helpful against evil. However, he&nbsp;was shown only in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few scenes in&nbsp;the movie and the director completely left him out of&nbsp;the plot.</p><p><h2>5. Voldemort’s eyes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f8/d9b/c602705de2b732a1b67743e46a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the movie, Lord Voldemort’s eyes are white. However, in&nbsp;the books, his eyes are red.</p><p><h2>6. Quidditch seasons were left out of&nbsp;Harry Potter and The Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/824/10f/0d65685e38be2779a76ee43210.png><p>The <a href=#>Quidditch</a> season was removed from the fifth movie. But in&nbsp;the book, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;important part because Ron Weasley joins the team as&nbsp;a&nbsp;keeper, replacing Olive Wood. This was a&nbsp;huge growth opportunity for Ron since he&nbsp;leads his team to&nbsp;victory. So, this was the time when he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;step out of&nbsp;Harry’s shadow.</p><p>Ron auditioned for the role in&nbsp;the sixth movie, but at&nbsp;this point, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit too late for his character to&nbsp;develop.</p><p><h2>7. The 2-way mirror importance wasn’t anticipated by&nbsp;the filmmakers so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was left out of&nbsp;The Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddf/294/5902e9568d978af3b5279a0967.jpg><p>Sirius gave <a href=#>Harry</a> one half of&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical mirror so&nbsp;that they could communicate in&nbsp;The Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix, but Harry later stuffed it&nbsp;away and vowed not to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it. However, he&nbsp;didn’t know that the mirror would be&nbsp;important in&nbsp;the future.</p><p>So, in&nbsp;the movie adaption, the mirror was completely cut out because, at&nbsp;that time, it&nbsp;didn’t seem very important. The filmmakers didn’t anticipate that the mirror would play an&nbsp;important part in&nbsp;the last novel. When the mirror did appear in&nbsp;the final movie, its origin wasn’t explained and this left many of&nbsp;us confused, especially those who didn’t read the book.</p><p><h2>8. A&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;Voldemort’s soul appeared in&nbsp;The Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/468/777/97de1a56c99572d9f8dfb08574.jpg><p>The important locket that turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>piece</a> of&nbsp;Voldemort’s soul, the Horcrux, appeared briefly in&nbsp;the fifth book, but at&nbsp;that time it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;jewelry. When Hermione, Ron, and Harry tried to&nbsp;clean the Black family house, they came in&nbsp;contact with different mysterious and dangerous objects, but the locket didn’t seem that important.</p><p>They tried to&nbsp;open the locket to&nbsp;check and see if&nbsp;there was something inside. When their attempt failed, they threw it&nbsp;away in&nbsp;the trash. However, just 2&nbsp;novels later the 3&nbsp;heroes had to&nbsp;track down the locket when they discovered that it&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;Voldemort’s soul. In&nbsp;the fifth movie, the locket was completely removed not anticipating its future importance since the next 2&nbsp;novels weren’t written yet.</p><p><h2>9. The cash prize was left out from the tournament during The Goblet of&nbsp;Fire.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c6/787/0cf4b75c999ab33ee3dc4568f7.jpg><p>After Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, he&nbsp;won a&nbsp;cash prize. But since, in&nbsp;the movies, there wasn’t a&nbsp;monetary specification, the prize wasn’t mentioned. This is&nbsp;important because in&nbsp;the book he&nbsp;gave his 1000 galleon winnings to&nbsp;Fred and George. With this money, they were able to&nbsp;start Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes shop.</p><p><h2>10. Neville Longbottom could have been the prophecy child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60b/3dd/6eeecc596e9ba7980c8fc43114.jpg><p>The prophecy about The Chosen One (told by&nbsp;Professor Trelawney) says: “Born to&nbsp;those who have thrice defied him, born as&nbsp;the seventh month dies”&nbsp;— this also applies to&nbsp;Neville Longbottom, but the soul focus was given to&nbsp;Harry Potter.</p><p><h2>11. Voldemort was incapable of&nbsp;love because of&nbsp;his parents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e02/2b9/122fce5272896266c9e4c963bf.png><p>Lord Voldemort’s most well-known characteristic is&nbsp;not being able to&nbsp;love, which is&nbsp;also important in&nbsp;the movie. This also <a href=#>explains</a> his evil ways, which becomes the reason why he&nbsp;gets defeated.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;incapable of&nbsp;love due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>love</a> potion. He&nbsp;was conceived under the influence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;love potion that his mother gave to&nbsp;his father. Snape also said that if&nbsp;someone is&nbsp;conceived under that kind of&nbsp;potion that they will never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;love.</p><p><h2>12. Harry and Hermione didn’t dance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/843/b94/dbe6cd57e997792fb8b56e48da.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry and Hermione danced in&nbsp;the tent. However, in&nbsp;the book they never did this.</p><p>Have you watched the Harry Potter movies? Or&nbsp;maybe you have only read the books? What did you miss most in&nbsp;the movies that was there in&nbsp;the books? Which fact from the list was most surprising to&nbsp;you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zedKuqamqmai2r7OMoZirqqlivbDA056pZpqfpLhussCcq6xlpJ2utXnWnqmeZZyas7V5zq6rZqeWYsGpsYympq%2Bhlah6eXyPbm9wZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1341529-50-happy-birthday-heaven-wishes-special-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 best happy birthday in heaven wishes for someone special</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./12-new-movies-thatll-keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-until-the-end-796326.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>12 New Movies Thatll Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat Until the End</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
