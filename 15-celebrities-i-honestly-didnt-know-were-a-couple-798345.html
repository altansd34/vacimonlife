They’ve had their loves and heartaches, relationships that can be&nbsp;fleeting, or&nbsp;romances worthy of&nbsp;their own <a href=# title=film data-link=tag>film</a>. The difference is&nbsp;that their personal lives are usually exposed in&nbsp;the media, and we&nbsp;all end up&nbsp;knowing even the tiniest details of&nbsp;their love stories.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>compiled a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;the love stories that shook <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> about a&nbsp;decade or&nbsp;so&nbsp;ago, and which you might not even remember. Who knows, they might even be&nbsp;new to&nbsp;you. Take a&nbsp;look!</p><p><h2>1. Salma Hayek and Edward Norton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa8/295/f8830a5e90811dd60ae677dee1.jpg><p>By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1990s, <a href=# title="Salma Hayek" data-link=tag>Salma Hayek</a> and Edward Norton were living a&nbsp;great moment in&nbsp;their respective careers as&nbsp;actors. At&nbsp;the same time, they were maintaining a&nbsp;romantic <a href=#>relationship</a> that few people remember today. Their romance began in&nbsp;1999, and didn’t end until 2003. During this time they were able to&nbsp;protect their private lives very effectively. They made very few public appearances, which might explain why we&nbsp;don’t really think of&nbsp;them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple anymore. They didn’t let themselves be&nbsp;seen together in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the cameras, except, of&nbsp;course, when it&nbsp;involved shooting a&nbsp;movie, like when they worked together on&nbsp;the film Frida.</p><p><h2>2. Johnny Depp and Kate Moss</h2></p><p>They started dating when she was 20&nbsp;and he&nbsp;was 31. Depp was already a&nbsp;very successful actor and Moss was a&nbsp;young successful model that had everyone at&nbsp;her feet. They had a&nbsp;relationship marked by&nbsp;scandal, mischief, and excess that resulted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;broken hotel room worth thousands of&nbsp;dollars in&nbsp;<a href=#>damage</a>. In&nbsp;1997, after almost 3&nbsp;years in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, they decided to&nbsp;part ways. However, in&nbsp;1998, they were seen together again during the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p><h2>3. Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel</h2></p><p>Both are considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;big shots in&nbsp;European cinema. Their love arose while they were filming the movie, <a href=#>The Apartment</a>, in&nbsp;1996. They were even <a href=#>married</a> for 14&nbsp;years and had 2&nbsp;daughters, however, they ended up&nbsp;divorcing in&nbsp;2013. Due to&nbsp;being an&nbsp;iconic couple in&nbsp;the cinema world and their incredible popularity, their breakup made it&nbsp;into all the tabloids at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2 align=center>4. Natalie Portman and Gael Garcia Bernal</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Natalie Portman" data-link=tag>Natalie Portman</a> and Gael Garcia Bernal dated in&nbsp;<a href=#>2006</a>, and during this time, the 2&nbsp;could be&nbsp;seen at&nbsp;various places together, like the China Club in&nbsp;Berlin or&nbsp;the 2007&nbsp;US Open Tennis Championships. Since then, however, <a href=#>Portman</a> married French dancer and choreographer, Benjamin Millepied, in&nbsp;2012, first dating him in&nbsp;2009, and <a href=#>Bernal</a> would later move on&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with Argentinian actress Dolores Fonzi from 2008 to&nbsp;2014.</p><p><h2 align=center>5. Jennifer Garner and Scott Foley</h2></p><p>The young actors were just beginning to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;name for themselves in&nbsp;the entertainment industry when they met in&nbsp;1998. They were working together on&nbsp;the series Felicity. They got married in&nbsp;2000, when they were both 28&nbsp;years old. In&nbsp;the meantime, Jennifer became a&nbsp;big celebrity, and in&nbsp;2003 word spread that they had decided to&nbsp;break&nbsp;up. Although they said it&nbsp;was all done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendly way, Garner said she and Foley <a href=#>actually</a> were “really victims of&nbsp;Hollywood.”</p><p><h2 align=center>6. Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland</h2></p><p>Flatliners was the film in&nbsp;which these 2&nbsp;actors shared credits and fell into the grips of&nbsp;love. They even got engaged and were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married on&nbsp;June&nbsp;14, 1991, in&nbsp;Los Angeles. But <a href=# title="Julia Roberts" data-link=tag>Julia Roberts</a> became a&nbsp;true runaway bride when she cancelled the wedding 2&nbsp;days before and ran away with Jason Patric, a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;Kiefer’s, to&nbsp;Ireland. In&nbsp;2016, Kiefer <a href=#>talked</a> about it&nbsp;and said he&nbsp;admired the courage that his then-girlfriend had when she made that call. Not everybody would dare to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that...</p><p><h2 align=center>7. Uma Thurman and Gary Oldman</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;1990, shortly after ending his marriage with his first wife, Lesley Manville, Gary Oldman entered into a&nbsp;relationship with actress <a href=# title="Uma Thurman" data-link=tag>Uma Thurman</a>. By&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;the following year, the couple was married and living together. However, 11&nbsp;months later, the relationship ended. She <a href=#>reportedly</a> broke up&nbsp;with him by&nbsp;writing a&nbsp;letter saying that he&nbsp;was impossible to&nbsp;live with. Thurman later said that it&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;special kind of&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with him.</p><p><h2>8. Sofia Vergara and Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/612/a10/a5297c572aa40cc24c5d562bef.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2005, <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a> and Sofia Vergara dated for a&nbsp;while. But as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was revealed in&nbsp;the actor’s official biography, this was not just any relationship for Tom, because he&nbsp;did <a href=#>everything</a> to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know her and then wanted to&nbsp;marry her. However, Cruise’s interest in&nbsp;Scientology was something Sofia did not share, so&nbsp;that put distance between the 2&nbsp;before they broke&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2 align=center>9. Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;was the 1990s, and Richard Gere was one of&nbsp;the most famous actors around after starring in&nbsp;the iconic film, Pretty Woman. And at&nbsp;the same time, Cindy Crawford was a&nbsp;highly regarded supermodel. Together, they became one of&nbsp;the most popular couples at&nbsp;the time. They got <a href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;1991 in&nbsp;an&nbsp;improvised wedding that took place in&nbsp;Las Vegas, where only close friends were invited. Gere was 42&nbsp;and Crawford was 25. But the breakup came soon after in&nbsp;1995.</p><p><h2 align=center>10. Bradley Cooper and Renée Zellweger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a1/574/8ddeb95d50a05836b74311f1cb.jpg><p>Their romance began while they were working <a href=#>together</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;film called Case&nbsp;39, Cooper said at&nbsp;the time. Their relationship started in&nbsp;2009 and lasted until 2011. Very little is&nbsp;known about the reasons behind their breakup, as&nbsp;they were always very discreet and wouldn’t let themselves be&nbsp;seen together on&nbsp;many occasions.</p><p><h2 align=center>11. Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff8/8b0/fd291b5af796cc7ee30b55a061.jpg><p>They played a&nbsp;couple in&nbsp;Seven in&nbsp;1994 and started a&nbsp;<a href=#>relationship</a> that lasted until 1997. She was <a href=#>24</a>&nbsp;at the time, which gave them a&nbsp;9-year age difference. They were close to&nbsp;finally tying the knot, but the actress panicked, especially as&nbsp;this was Paltrow’s first high-profile relationship with another celebrity.</p><p><h2 align=center>12. Jay-Z and Rosario Dawson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f51/cf7/e277d554f8b921daad2c6e7619.jpg><p>Today, Beyoncé and Jay-Z are one of&nbsp;the most popular <a href=#>couples</a> in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, but before that, the rapper dated actress Rosario Dawson for a&nbsp;while, around the year 2000. However, they never talked about it&nbsp;or&nbsp;really made any statement to&nbsp;the press. Most journalists that’ve covered the topic now believe they dated for about 3&nbsp;years.</p><p><h2>13. Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/637/e87/9131f559b0977eae18ddfca550.jpg><p>About a&nbsp;decade ago, Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds were a&nbsp;Hollywood star couple, announcing their <a href=#>engagement</a> in&nbsp;2008 and marrying in&nbsp;September of&nbsp;that same year. Their marriage lasted a&nbsp;little less than <a href=#>3</a>&nbsp;years, after which their differences proved too great for them to&nbsp;continue&nbsp;on. They announced that they had separated in&nbsp;2010 and their divorce was finalized in&nbsp;2011.</p><p><h2>14. Naomi Watts and Heath Ledger</h2></p><p>Heath Ledger, who delivered one of&nbsp;the Joker’s most acclaimed performances, had a&nbsp;2-year <a href=#>relationship</a> with actress Naomi Watts. The love between these 2&nbsp;blossomed in&nbsp;2002&nbsp;on the set of&nbsp;the film, Ned Kelly, where she was amazed by&nbsp;Ledger’s intensity when acting. They began a&nbsp;romantic relationship that, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;mentioned before, lasted 2&nbsp;years, but they were apart for a&nbsp;while in&nbsp;2003. Even after the actor’s untimely death, Watts still remembers him with affection. “We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;beautiful relationship, just for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years, but he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;man who was completely full of&nbsp;joy, and there was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;laughing and affection in&nbsp;him,” Watts recalled.</p><p><h2 align=center>15. Courteney Cox and Michael Keaton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e57/af4/cae48150228d2c10f1ddaeb07b.jpg><p>They spent almost 6&nbsp;years <a href=#>together</a> until they decided to&nbsp;part ways in&nbsp;July 1995. “It’s the most important relationship I’ve ever had, and&nbsp;I think he’s the most wonderful person I’ve ever met,” Courteney Cox said just a&nbsp;few months after the breakup. In&nbsp;fact, a&nbsp;ring on&nbsp;the actress’ hand had raised rumors about an&nbsp;engagement, but she later clarified that the piece of&nbsp;jewelry was actually her grandmother’s.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;favorite couple in&nbsp;show business? Which one is&nbsp;it?</p><p>Tom Cruise’s <a href=#>unwavering dedication to&nbsp;his mother</a>, Mary, has been a&nbsp;cornerstone of&nbsp;his life. From a&nbsp;young age, Cruise shouldered responsibilities, supporting his family after his father’s departure. Despite facing upheavals, including frequent relocations and his parents’ divorce, Cruise remained a&nbsp;pillar of&nbsp;strength for his family. He&nbsp;took on&nbsp;various jobs before venturing into acting, always prioritizing his family’s needs. His bond with his mother was evident throughout his life, with Mary often accompanying him to&nbsp;events. Cruise attributes much of&nbsp;his success to&nbsp;the values instilled by&nbsp;his mother, cherishing their deep connection until her passing in&nbsp;2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecKeo56aop7BqrHSZqBmoJ%2BjsrTAy7JknaGUo8Fut82ormavlaeybq2MnKauqJyaeniFl2xrbmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-household-brand-names-that-weve-been-saying-wrong-all-this-time-800392.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Household Brand Names That Weve Been Saying Wrong All This Time</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1579087-warm-birthday-wishes-worker-feel-loved.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>100+ warm birthday wishes for coworkers to make them feel loved</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
