A lot can and will change in that time. But, retailers know that holiday shopping is just around the corner.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The last few holiday seasons have no doubt been financially stressful for consumers. Still, the holidays are something to look forward to: A June 2024 survey saw that shoppers are more excited (68%) than anxious (55%) about the year-end holiday season. The cohort most likely to say they’re anxious? Millennials, the generation currently sandwiched between caring for young children and their aging parents.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Based on what we know happened last year and current consumer economic trends, here are&nbsp; four predictions for retailers to take into planning for the year end sales bonanza.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Prediction #1: Use of buy now, pay later loans will grow</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Buy now, pay later loans continue to be popular with shoppers, especially young consumers. Those who have kept up discretionary spending despite inflation are increasingly leaning on BNPL and away from high interest credit cards. In the 2023 holiday season BNPL was a key part of shoppers’ financial plans, particularly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>financially anxious and high income shoppers</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A recent announcement from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau confirmed that BNPL lenders are in effect credit card providers, and subject to the same consumer protection regulations as traditional credit card companies. This should only serve to enhance consumers’ perception of BNPL providers as a reliable financial tool.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Prediction #2: “Value” will remain the word of the year</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Consumer spending has remained relatively strong throughout this inflationary period, though signs of weakness are showing, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>particularly among middle-income households</a>. About one-third (34%) of consumers say “giving a gift for a wedding, birthday or other occasion would put a strain on their finances for the month,” a share that’s increasing for the middle income bracket.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Retailers including Walgreens, Best Buy and Michaels are responding to consumers’ pull back and announced significant price drops, particularly on general merchandise and household goods. In an already heavily promotional time of year, retailers should expect stiff competition on price as consumers find the lowest cost ways to keep the holiday magic alive. Cheap and cheerful gifts and decor will win this year.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Prediction #3: Early bird shoppers will be looking to splurge</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Last year saw a significant jump in early shopping (17 weeks before Christmas) from Gen Zers (+13 percentage points form 2022 to 2023) and high earners (+7 percentage points over the same period). Rather than trying to shop early to spread holiday expenses out over more time and paychecks, early bird shoppers were just having fun.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This year, shoppers with more discretionary flexibility in their budgets will once again be eager for an excuse to shop and spend. Major sale events like Black Friday (which is not necessarily meaningfully tied to the Friday after Thanksgiving) encourage stocking up on gifts for others, as well as treats for oneself.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Prediction #4: Special shopping events will lure shoppers into stores</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Store enjoyment is on the upswing as inflation cools, particularly among high-income shoppers. Higher prices sucked the fun out of shopping, but <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>early 2024 data shows a rebound</a>. Retailers, especially those catering to younger customers, should plan for events in a big way. Beyond the typical pictures with Santa, consumers are most interested in events with food and drinks — a great opportunity for brand partnerships — and special brand events.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">These events aren’t explicitly tied to winter holidays, and retailers should deploy these options year-round to draw in young shoppers. E-commerce brands without physical spaces should seek out brick-and-mortar partners for pop up events, and vice versa: bringing a brand that consumers don’t often get to shop in person is a good draw for store foot traffic.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX528rbXDmrBmamBngW6%2BxK2YoqRdqLWwvM%2BipaBlpKeyr7DSZqernZSesLW1zqeq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-katie-holmes-raised-her-daughter-suri-into-a-humble-teen-despite-her-ultra-privileged-life-816056.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Katie Holmes Raised Her Daughter Suri Into a Humble Teen Despite Her Ultra-Privileged Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./haagen-dazs-vanilla-ice-cream.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hagen-Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
