The 34-year old The Four contestant effortlessly showed off her rapping skills on the competition show that usually helps launch superstar singers. Sharaya was animated and was quick with her words. Judges P.Diddy, DJ Khaled</b>, and Meghan Trainor were all impressed by the entertainer and her onstage antics.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sharaya-s-early-beginnings>Sharaya’s Early Beginnings</h2><p>Sharaya was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, but she was raised in New Jersey. The entertainer grew up in a music household with her father being one-fifth of the hip-hop group&nbsp;Double XX Posse. Before entering the music industry as a rapper, Sharaya was a choreographer. She was featured in videos from Alicia Keys, The Dream, and Jay-Z. She was also a featured dancer in the movies&nbsp;Step Up 2: The Streets&nbsp;and&nbsp;Step Up 3D.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-missy-elliot-walks-into-a-bar>Missy Elliot Walks Into a Bar</h2><p>Maybe not a bar exactly, but Sharaya’s dance career caught the attention of the legendary Missy Elliot. The rapper signed Sharaya to her music label The Goldmind Inc. in 2010. The same year she released her single “Green Light.” The song featured vocals from Elliot herself. Sharaya also joined Elliot on her sold-out European tour. Elliot was also a featured vocalist on Sharaya’s 2013 hit “Banji.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sharaya-starts-her-own-production-company>Sharaya Starts Her Own Production Company</h2><p>Although the rapper found mild success under Elliot’s music label, Sharaya had her eyes set on a bigger future. She left The Goldmind to form her own production company, Banji Entertainment LLC. Sharaya’s new venture was based in Brooklyn, NY, and she released her single “Big” from under the imprint. The rapper named her company based on how she lived her life. Banji stands for <strong>B</strong><span>e </span><strong>A</strong><span>uthentic </span><strong>N</strong><span>ever </span><strong>J</strong><span>eopardize </span><strong>I</strong><span>ndividuality</span>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sharaya-on-the-four>Sharaya on ‘The Four’</h2><p>The rapper was electrifying to say the least. Every episode Sharaya was on fire. Her original rhymes were enough to show hip hop icon P.Diddy that she had what it took to make it in the music industry. The rapper made the show’s history when she became the longest seat holder, always ending up back as one of The Four. Sharaya’s season ended with her being the runner-up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/KBbkUcNKf4Y</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-breast-cancer-survivor>Breast Cancer Survivor</h2><p>What made Sharaya even more impressive during The Four Season 2 is her fight off stage. The rapper was battling Stage 2 breast cancer while competing on the show. After every performance Sharaya would return to Atlanta, GA, to undergo chemo. The rapper was open about her fight when she openly showed her hair loss on stage. Sharaya is now cancer free.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-life-after-the-four>Life After ‘The Four’</h2><p>Sharaya has continued to blaze her own path in the <a href=#>music industry.</a> She has released multiple singles and is currently working on new music. Sharaya has also flexed her songwriting skills on Little Mix’s “Strip.” On social media the rapper shows off her artistic side through fashion and she is also launching products. She is also a host on the Be 100 Morning Radio Show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1390944525.jpg alt="Carrie Underwood Steals the Show With Aerial Acrobatics at the CMT Music Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>sharaya j</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the four</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGcq51dnsBuwMeeZJ%2BnpafAbr7AqWSaqqSewLV50qGYq5mplnqrecCfq56qXZ2ys3nEqaCcZaOarrS7zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-do-you-want-to-see-compete-on-season-6-of-the-masked-singer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Do You Want to See Compete on Season 6 of 'The Masked Singer'?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1185132-bible-verses-prosperity-wealth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 50 scriptures on prosperity and wealth: Motivational Bible verses</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
