Those aged 25 to 44 are most prone to fretting about losing their job, at 63%, while furloughed workers aged 55 and over are the least nervous at 50%.</p><p>Furloughed employees aged 18 to 24 are the most likely age group to feel anxious about how the pandemic will impact their career progression (60%) and professional development (55%).</p><p>The older workers get, the less worried they are about the impact of the pandemic on these aspects of their working life, with only a quarter of the oldest workers (those aged 55+) concerned about their career progression, and just one in five worried about their professional development.</p><p>While most furloughed workers have contemplated the prospect of getting laid off, only 11% actually believe they’re unlikely to get their job back. This includes one in twenty (5%) who say it’s “very” unlikely.</p><p>If these instincts are right, it could amount to around 517,000 redundancies in the coming months, as <a href=#>4.7 million workers</a> were furloughed as of January. This is in line with <a href=#>predictions</a> from the ONS and the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p><p>Most furloughed workers feel confident that they’ll get to stay in their job, with just over a third (36%) saying it’s very likely, while another 42% feel fairly certain.</p><p>The research also shows that around one in ten furloughed workers (10%) have not had any communication from their employer since being sent home, while 37% say it has been scarce.</p><p>Around half have either had a fair amount of communication (34%) or a lot (18%).</p><h3>Some furloughed workers have started job hunting, others want to retrain</h3><p><a href=#>Rishi Sunak has previously suggested</a> that people ‘in all walks of life’ should look to find new opportunities. Three in ten furloughed workers (30%) have already started looking for other work, rising to almost half (47%) of those aged 18 to 24.</p><p>A fifth (19%) say they would like to apply for new jobs but there are none in their sector. Around two fifths (44%) are not looking for other work – rising to two thirds (64%) of those aged 55 and older.</p><p>The Chancellor has similarly encouraged workers to retrain, saying they should ‘find ways to adapt and adjust to the new reality'. Around three in ten furloughed workers (28%) say they’re likely to retrain in another sector. This prospect is most popular among younger workers aged 18 to 24 (47%). It drops significantly among those aged 45 to 54 (14%) and 55+ (15%).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksqS7zaiksmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZWeBennMqKqtZamkwq%2BzjJ%2Bsq6SfqrSpscNmrqiqm5q%2FtHnFnpirZZmivaKv02aamqqVmr9urQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./my-mil-wants-to-wear-a-white-gown-at-my-wedding-817270.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My MIL Decided to Show Up at My Wedding in a White Dress</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1319855-milo-ventimiglia-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-movies-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Milo Ventimiglia bio: age, height, net worth, girlfriend, movies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
