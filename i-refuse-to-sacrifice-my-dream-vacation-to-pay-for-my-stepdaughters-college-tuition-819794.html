Do you really think people were going to say anything other than you are a horrible human? Are you delusional? I'm confused why you didn't pay for your sons college tuition though? You would rather take a vacation and let someone else foot the bill for your kid? If your kind generous way to good for you husband hadn't paid for your kids tuition he would have the money for his daughters tuition! While all the time you think your money should be spent on you Not your children not your husband! So his money is your money and your money is your money? Yuck definitely an AH</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e4/074/047c9856b599dc7c6e5f5992df.jpg><p>Also why are these kids going to college just assuming that it's going to be paid for. Get scholarships if possible, get loans, get a part time job like most people do if you wanna go that badly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b6/4d8/fe609050ada60bfafa137a02a0.jpg><p>NTA. You have taken care of your step daughter in other ways. Such as cooking for, cleaning up after her, driving her places, simply being there for her as her mom. If your husband knew that your savings was designated for your trip, he doesn't have the right to ask you for it. But if you feel conflicted, you may consider purchasing her books. Go on your trip as planned.</p><p><strong>Thank you, Julia, for sharing your story with&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;understand that you feel torn and don’t want to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;your dream vacation while also keeping peace in&nbsp;the family.

Explain why the trip is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;you, and express your appreciation for his past contributions. Try to&nbsp;understand his perspective and work together to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;middle ground that respects both of&nbsp;your wishes.</p><p><h2>Discuss financial boundaries.</h2></p><p>It’s important to&nbsp;set clear financial boundaries in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blended family. Review any past agreements about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paying</a> for each other’s children. This can help clarify expectations and prevent future conflicts.</p><p><h2>Consider partial contributions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/124/f88/fcecc6578193f63c93c531d137.jpg><p>You dont owe anyone college tuition. Child or stepchild. Just because your husband made a choice to pay for your son does not mean you have to pay for his daughter just because he assumed you would. If this was not something that you agreed to do and he specifically knew you were saving for this dream and still expected you to pay. That's his problem. You are not responsible for other people's expectations.</p><p>If&nbsp;possible, think about contributing a&nbsp;smaller amount towards your stepdaughter’s tuition. This gesture shows goodwill and can help ease tensions while still allowing you to&nbsp;save for your dream trip. Talk to&nbsp;your husband about this option to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;workable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>compromise</a>.</p><p><h2>Plan for both goals.</h2></p><p>Explore ways to&nbsp;achieve both goals without giving up&nbsp;one for the other. Look into financial aid <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>options</a>, scholarships, or&nbsp;part-time work for your stepdaughter to&nbsp;help pay for her <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a>. At&nbsp;the same time, reassess your savings plan to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;you can adjust it&nbsp;to&nbsp;cover both your trip and a&nbsp;partial contribution.</p><p><h2>Consider a&nbsp;family meeting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/586/b2a/6c14d65134ba0a3829b098ee39.jpg><p>Arrange a&nbsp;family meeting that includes your stepdaughter.
