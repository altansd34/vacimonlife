However, while we&nbsp;are used to&nbsp;seeing Belle in&nbsp;her yellow costume when dancing with the Beast, the reality is&nbsp;that, in&nbsp;the 18th century, <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> had nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with what we&nbsp;see onscreen. That’s why we&nbsp;asked artificial intelligence to&nbsp;design the correct versions of&nbsp;these characters’ dresses, and now we&nbsp;are sharing the results with you.</p><p><h2>1. Snow White in&nbsp;Germany’s 15th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/37e/2d9/261bbc5eb390ac5e54cc9f19a9.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>original</a> tale, published in&nbsp;1937, was inspired by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Margaretha von Waldeck</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=# title=German data-link=tag>German</a> countess born in&nbsp;1533, which suggests that the story is&nbsp;set in&nbsp;that period.</p><p>Unlike the dress shown by&nbsp;the Disney animators, in&nbsp;the 15th century, women wore much more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>extravagant</a>, high-waisted garments with layers of&nbsp;linen underneath. Another major difference with the Disney design is&nbsp;the sleeves. In&nbsp;reality, women’s garments had detachable long sleeves that flared out at&nbsp;the shoulders.</p><p><h2>2. Aurora in&nbsp;France’s 14th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36b/563/4612005f26b5554748ec3ca452.jpg><p>The best-known version of&nbsp;this tale is&nbsp;credited to&nbsp;Charles Perrault in&nbsp;his 1697 book <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Histoires ou&nbsp;contes du&nbsp;temps passé</i></a>, but there are records of&nbsp;the story from a&nbsp;few centuries ago, between 1330 and 1344 in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Perceforest</i></a>. Therefore, it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;said that the protagonist lived around that time.</p><p>During this period, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>women</a> wore dresses rather tight to&nbsp;the silhouette and did not want to&nbsp;widen their hips with wide skirts. On&nbsp;the contrary, the dressmakers of&nbsp;that era tried, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible, to&nbsp;avoid adding volume to&nbsp;that area. Instead, the more formal models wore long trains. In&nbsp;addition, it&nbsp;was common to&nbsp;wear gowns over the attire that fell over the shoulders as&nbsp;layers.</p><p><h2>3. Cinderella in&nbsp;Germany’s 19th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e0/354/087117529bbc83a7820d229d2b.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Brothers Grimm</a> published the best-known version of&nbsp;this tale in&nbsp;their 1812 collection <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</i></a>. However, the oldest records of&nbsp;this story date back to&nbsp;the 7th century&nbsp;BC and 1st century AD.</p><p>Since, thanks to&nbsp;the Brothers Grimm, <a href=# title=Cinderella data-link=tag>Cinderella</a> would be&nbsp;remembered as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tale of&nbsp;German tradition, we&nbsp;will describe how she should have looked in&nbsp;the 19th century. At&nbsp;this time, dresses began to&nbsp;become increasingly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>extravagant</a> and theatrical, with a&nbsp;growing trend until the end of&nbsp;Romanticism.</p><p><h2>4. Jasmin in&nbsp;Middle Eastern fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdb/441/085573540ea6d5952ea9adb7d8.jpg><p>Originally, Aladdin is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best-known stories in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>One Thousand and One Nights</i></a>. As&nbsp;for the story’s setting, the first lines of&nbsp;the tale say, “In&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the cities of&nbsp;China.” However, such a&nbsp;setting is&nbsp;not mentioned again in&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the story, and some elements may suggest that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Aladdin</a>’s story takes place somewhere in&nbsp;the ancient Near East.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also worth noting that the story was included in&nbsp;the book thanks to&nbsp;the Syrian writer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hanna Diyab</a>, and, in&nbsp;ancient Arabic, the term “China” was used to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;distant and exotic lands. Because of&nbsp;this, and to&nbsp;follow the traditional depiction of&nbsp;the story, we&nbsp;will describe what Jasmine’s attire should have looked like in&nbsp;the ancient Near East.</p><p>Attire in&nbsp;this region has evolved very little over the years, as&nbsp;its purpose remains the same: to&nbsp;protect from the harsh climate and sand. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the differences between countries are also quite subtle.</p><p>The basic garments were a&nbsp;shirt with sleeves, loose pants and a&nbsp;tunic. Then, over this cloak, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>jellaba</i></a>, a&nbsp;dress with long sleeves and a&nbsp;skirt with slits on&nbsp;the sides, was added. For the most part, all this is&nbsp;in&nbsp;cream colors and embroidered with bright fabrics.</p><p><h2>5. Tiana in&nbsp;U.S.’s 1926 fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e17/80c/90f8d058ad95558d1f92ef5346.jpg><p>The original story is&nbsp;German, as&nbsp;the Brothers <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Grimm</a> officially published it&nbsp;in&nbsp;1812, and they took the idea from the country’s oral tradition. However, Disney’s 2009 adaptation is&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular case since it&nbsp;was loosely based on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Frog Princess</i></a>, an&nbsp;adaptation of&nbsp;the original tale published by&nbsp;E.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Baker in&nbsp;2002.</p><p>Therefore, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;story with such apparent changes from the original tale, we&nbsp;will describe how Tiana’s attire should have looked, according to&nbsp;the Disney adaptation, in&nbsp;the 1920s and the United States.</p><p>Fashion at&nbsp;the time evolved in&nbsp;opposition to&nbsp;previous trends. It&nbsp;was all about “letting yourself&nbsp;go”, so&nbsp;the dresses were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loose</a>, low-waisted. They barely showed the woman’s silhouette and reached almost the ankles, sometimes the knees.</p><p><h2>6. Bella in&nbsp;France’s 18th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42c/e27/56ea7350d4bee77f777b9c665b.jpg><p>Disney based one of&nbsp;its most famous animated classics on&nbsp;the story, <i>La&nbsp;Belle et&nbsp;la&nbsp;Bête</i>, written by&nbsp;French novelist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de&nbsp;Villeneuve</a> in&nbsp;1740. One would think that the story takes place in&nbsp;the same period it&nbsp;was written. Then, Bella should have had very different dresses, according to&nbsp;the French fashion of&nbsp;the 18th century.</p><p>A&nbsp;typical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>characteristic</a> of&nbsp;the dresses of&nbsp;the time was the fitted bodice. They had a&nbsp;square neckline, large ribbon bows, and lace and flowers on&nbsp;the front. As&nbsp;for colors, pastel shades were chosen to&nbsp;give an&nbsp;elegant and youthful appearance. The sleeves were flared and ended at&nbsp;the elbows to&nbsp;reveal the sleeves of&nbsp;the nightgown worn under the dress.</p><p><h2>7. Merida in&nbsp;Scotland’s 10th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d46/ca4/29bb845f1c9dfdfaf4798283c7.jpg><p><i>Brave</i> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Pixar original story released in&nbsp;2012 and set in&nbsp;medieval Scotland. Merida’s costumes in&nbsp;the film are much more faithful to&nbsp;reality than those of&nbsp;other Disney princesses. However, some elements of&nbsp;medieval European fashion are not shown.</p><p>For example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>women’s dresses</a> of&nbsp;that time usually included tunics. On&nbsp;the outside, a&nbsp;long cloak could be&nbsp;worn as&nbsp;a&nbsp;coat fastened to&nbsp;the inner clothing with a&nbsp;belt at&nbsp;the waist. In&nbsp;addition, socks may have been worn on&nbsp;the legs and veils on&nbsp;the head.</p><p><h2>8. Rapunzel in&nbsp;Germany’s 17th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/caf/a7e/ec1f6b56f3b2a9d0f1f189fc62.jpg><p><i>Tangled</i>, released in&nbsp;2010, is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the fairy tale <i>Rapunzel</i>, published by&nbsp;the Brothers <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Grimm</a> in&nbsp;1812, who, in&nbsp;turn, found it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the French story <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Persinette</i></a>, written by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charlotte-Rose de&nbsp;Caumont de&nbsp;La&nbsp;Force</a> in&nbsp;1698.</p><p>Taking that into account, the story of&nbsp;the lost princess is&nbsp;set at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 17th century in&nbsp;Germany. Back then, women <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wore</a> low-cut corsets, broad at&nbsp;the shoulders and narrow at&nbsp;the waist. The sleeves were wide and loose and ended at&nbsp;the elbow while the skirt reached down to&nbsp;the feet. However, over time, the length of&nbsp;the skirt was reduced to&nbsp;reveal the petticoat.</p><p><h2>9. Meg in&nbsp;Ancient Greece’s fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7cc/65a/f86a5551ec92f801c4b4cc50fa.jpg><p><i>Hercules</i> revolves around the adventures of&nbsp;the Greek demigod, and while it’s not explicitly said that it&nbsp;takes place in&nbsp;Ancient Greece, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;inferred because of&nbsp;certain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>things</a> mentioned throughout the film.</p><p>Greek women back then wore relatively simple and loose-fitting clothes. Its primary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purpose</a> was functional, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;did not seek to&nbsp;bestow identity. Their clothing consisted of&nbsp;two pieces: an&nbsp;undergarment and a&nbsp;cape. The major difference between the women’s and men’s clothing was that the ladies’ tunic went down to&nbsp;the ankles, while the men’s only went down to&nbsp;the knees.</p><p>The colors were often neutral, but tailors would add decorative borders in&nbsp;bright shades. However, the latter was only common among upper-class people. Purple, in&nbsp;particular, was considered a&nbsp;most notable sign of&nbsp;wealth in&nbsp;clothing due to&nbsp;its price.</p><p><h2>10. Elsa in&nbsp;European 19th century fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95f/c32/520e735ab492fa0a508fa80c74.jpg><p>Frozen is&nbsp;loosely based on&nbsp;the fairy tale <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Snow Queen</i></a>, published by&nbsp;Danish writer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hans Christian Andersen</a> in&nbsp;1844. So, considering the source of&nbsp;inspiration for Disney’s story, it&nbsp;could have been set in&nbsp;the 19th century, somewhere in&nbsp;Europe, since the kingdom of&nbsp;Arendelle is&nbsp;fictional.</p><p>Assuming the analysis is&nbsp;correct, Elsa must have had a&nbsp;similar style to&nbsp;Cinderella’s since fashion among European countries did not vary much. In&nbsp;this sense, she must have had a&nbsp;much more defined structure, a&nbsp;wide skirt and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>extravagant decorations</a>.</p><p>If&nbsp;you like transformations and fun fact about Disney, check out these articles:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmaGlllJ7Ar7HYZqeroZ6YsrS%2FxKxksKelobFuw8SaqWahlmLBqbHYZq6eqpVirqTA1JqjZqCZqMGwvsicmKVlk52us63CrZyrq11tfnKEl2xm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./webinar-brands-engaging-politics-us-2024-election.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Brands Need to Know About Engaging in Politics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-compared-5-top-selling-pillows-on-amazon-so-that-you-can-find-the-perfect-one-for-your-sleeping-style-809876.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Compared 5 Top Selling Pillows on Amazon So That You Can Find the Perfect One for Your Sleeping S</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
