Compared to other languages that are softer to the ear, like French, German phonetics may be perceived as harsh. Of course, this sentiment may have a cultural origin. Many non-German speakers associate the language with Adolf Hitler’s warmongering speeches, which were famously ridiculed in Charlie Chaplin’s Great Dictator.&nbsp;</p><p>While not every German word sounds like it’s being shouted in anger, there are some aggressive-sounding German words that could give you a good scare if you don’t know what they mean. In an attempt to prove that German really isn’t so scary after all, we’ve selected and defined five German words that sound particularly aggressive to foreign ears.</p><li><a href=#>Purzelbaum</a></li><li><a href=#>Kinderkrankheit</a></li><li><a href=#>Streichholzschachtel</a></li><li><a href=#>Zungenbrecher</a></li><li><a href=#>Geschlechtsverkehr</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Purzelbaum>1. Purzelbaum</h2><p>The German word Purzelbaum can sound particularly aggressive if the “r” is rolled and followed by pronouncing the “z” as a sharp “t” combined with a hissing sound. Its meaning doesn’t quite match its sound. Compared to the English translation, “somersault,” Purzelbaum sounds a bit less fun and whimsical. Nevertheless, once you understand its meaning, it will seem less harsh: Purzelbaum is a combination of the verb purzeln, which means “to tumble,” and Baum, which translates to “tree.” Consequently, Purzelbaum literally means “tumbling tree.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Kinderkrankheit>2. Kinderkrankheit</h2><p>German words with a lot of hard “k” sounds are prone to sounding aggressive to foreigners. The word Kinderkrankheit is a repeat offender, offering not only a few “k” sounds but a “kr-” combination that can sound like a guttural scraping noise. The literal translation of Kinderkrankheit is “children’s illness,” but it is often used creatively to describe problems in the early stages of a project.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Streichholzschachtel>3. Streichholzschachtel</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Compound nouns</a> like Streichholzschachtel, the German word for “matchbox,” are among the most difficult to pronounce for German learners. Not only is the word very long, but its pronunciation switches from “sh-” sounds that seem to happen in the front of the mouth, to sounds that are produced in the back of the throat. The combination can sound rather rough and is easily mistaken for an angry-sounding swear word.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Zungenbrecher>4. Zungenbrecher</h2><p>Zungenbrecher is the German word for “tongue twister.” At least some people would argue that the hard way the “z” is pronounced in this word, combined with the guttural “ch-” sound at the end, can twist your tongue and be hard on your ears as well. Have you tried your luck at a typical <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German Zungenbrecher</a> yet? Here’s one to try: Brautkleid bleibt Brautkleid und Blaukraut bleibt Blaukraut.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Geschlechtsverkehr>5. Geschlechtsverkehr</h2><p>Admittedly, the German word for “sex” does not sound particularly erotic or fun. The combination of hard sounds easily qualifies it for the category of German words that sound angry to foreigners. In defense of German speakers, Geschlechtsverkehr is mostly used as a medical term. In more casual contexts, the word Sex is commonly used.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>An angry-sounding language?</h2><p>There are a lot of aggressive-sounding German words that fuel the perception that German is a harsh language. The five examples that we have listed in this article may sound funny to you if you stumble across them while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning German</a>. The combination of hard sounds like “k” and “p,” the rolled “r” and the guttural “ch-” sound are not only harder to pronounce for German learners — they can also sound aggressive when you are not used to them!</p><p>Nevertheless, you shouldn’t let the harsh phonetics distract you from the many complex and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful German expressions</a> this language has to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lea-Hauke-Foto-1-1.jpg><h2>Lea Hauke</h2><p>Lea is a writer and translator for English and German and lives in Austria.
