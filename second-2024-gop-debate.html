The decline was slightly larger among voters supporting Trump, 2 in 5 of whom see the matchups as that important, compared with 36% of the people backing someone else.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s the latest sign that the party faithful are taking their cues from Trump, who clearly doesn’t see Wednesday’s Reagan Library stage as important, and will instead be in Michigan to meet with union workers — some of whom are core to his coalition as his presence in the GOP has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>helped improve the GOP’s brand with the working class</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite his <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>dominance in the race nationwide</a>, Trump’s decision not to participate in the first two matchups — and the idea that he may not participate in future ones — nevertheless remains at odds with the bulk of views among the GOP’s electorate.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The vast majority of potential Republican primary voters (72%) said Trump should participate in at least some debates, similar to the share who said the same before the Aug. 23 debate, compared with 17% who said he should participate in no debates. However, the gap has closed on the question for Trump supporters and those backing someone else. The former have become less likely to think he should participate, while the latter are pushing for him to show up.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Without Trump on stage, expectations are high for entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, the No. 3 contender for the nomination, who had 9% backing in the&nbsp; latest update to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>our GOP primary tracker</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Roughly a third of voters expect Ramaswamy to perform best, matching the share who said the same last month, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — the No. 2 contender, with 15% support in our tracking of the primary contest — has seen expectations drop, while they’ve grown for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who enters the second contest on stronger footing than she did the first.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When it comes to the issues at hand, there has been a slight uptick in the share of voters who said it’s “very important” for the candidates to discuss the economy (from 79% to 85%) and immigration (69% to 74%), while the share who prioritize China has fallen (51% to 46%).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Three in 10 potential Republican primary voters say it’s very important that candidates discuss Trump (31%) or President Joe Biden (32%).&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Our ongoing tracking of the GOP’s 2024 presidential contest suggests Trump paid no price for skipping the first debate. And ahead of the second debate, the fact that GOP primary voters are decreasingly likely to see the debates as pivotal provides another sign that Trump’s debate evasion strategy is working — or at least isn’t hurting him.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Barring any major gaffe from candidates on stage with significant support, such as DeSantis or Ramaswamy, the second debate is unlikely to shift the trajectory of the contest for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination given the fragmented nature of the forces in the party pushing for someone other than Trump to carry the mantle next year.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6iypLvNnWRraGJpeqi7z2abnpqRqbI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./33901-scientists-and-doctors-are-most-respected-professi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scientists and doctors are the most respected professions worldwide</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1518005-finally-nigerian-immigration-releases-fresh-update-job-applicants.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Recruitment: Nigerian Immigration Releases Fresh Update for Job Applicants, cautions against scammer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
