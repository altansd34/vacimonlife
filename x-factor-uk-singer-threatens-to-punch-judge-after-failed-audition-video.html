This was the case for the singing trio who called themselves Angel during their audition for The X Factor UK in 2011.</strong> <strong>Take a look at their audition below that left one group member threatening to punch a judge in the face.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-girl-group-has-rocky-audition-on-the-x-factor-uk>Girl Group Has Rocky Audition On ‘The X Factor UK’</h2><p>Angel did synchronized choreography at the beginning of their audition with some shoulder shimmies and hair flips. Unfortunately when they began singing “Whip My Hair” by Willow Smith the cringing look on judge Kelly Rowland’s face told us everything we needed to know.</p><p>Kelly stopped the performance midway through. She turned to Tulisa to ask for her opinion about the performance. “I’m just going to put it as bluntly as possible” Tulisa said. “I think all of the energy and all of the dance moves is to cover up the fact that none of you can really sing.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>‘X FACTOR’ CONTESTANT GOES ON A FULL BLOWN VERBAL SHOWDOWN WITH THE JUDGES [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>This prompted the sassiest response ever from one of the group members, Vanessa Threadgold. “That was a bit rich coming from you,” she said to Tulisa. Judge Louis Walsh could not believe her attitude. His jaw was literally on the floor. This prompted the audience to “boo” Angel really hard.</p><p>“Coming from a female group that always talked about how women should come together and they shouldn’t be bitchy towards one another I understand that you have an opinion” Kelly started. “But at the same time, you came here for us to judge you and there was no reason for you to come back at her like that.”</p><p>Check out the compilation below featuring 10 of the rudest contestants who challenged the judges. It will seriously make you cringe.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-girls-stormed-off-the-stage-and-one-group-member-went-on-an-angry-rant>The Girls Stormed Off The Stage And One Group Member Went On An Angry Rant</h3><p>It was clear that none of the judges felt that Angel was strong enough to move on in the competition. They all voted “no.” As the girls were walking off the stage, Tulisa said “don’t enter the kitchen if you can’t handle the heat.” Backstage, the girls gathered their thoughts.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>‘X FACTOR’ CONTESTANT PUNCHES HER AUDITION PARTNER IN THE FACE [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>“Unhappy times. I think that was her being bitchy; I was just doing the same back. It’s just one of those things, that’s how I am, but I was about ready to punch her in the face if I’m perfectly honest” Vanessa confessed. When another group member suggested that next time the girls should bite their tongues, Vanessa flashed a smile.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-was-the-aftermath-of-angel-s-x-factor-uk-audition>What Was The Aftermath Of Angel’s ‘X Factor UK’ Audition?</h3><p>After Angels’ audition for The X Factor UK aired on television, Vanessa spoke out saying that people taunted her for her comments. She also accused the show of poor editing. “It was edited to make me look a right cow,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she said.</a> “I’m not a rude person, just a straight-talking Yorkshire lass. I’m shocked at how it came over and the way Tulisa took my comment to heart.”</p><p>Vanessa was especially angry that the show continuously played the clip. “The way ‘X Factor’ keeps showing that clip has ruined my life. I can’t step out of the house without someone shouting after me: ‘That’s rich.’ I’ve even had the neighbors knocking on my door about it” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHIUG3jBwlZ/</p></figure><p>It’s really no surprise that Angel has split up since their fiery audition.
