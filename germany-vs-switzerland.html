As such, the two countries have many things in common, including a shared language, an excellent quality of life and relatively strong economies. However, they also differ in significant ways, from cost of living to salaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Wondering whether it’s better to live in Germany or Switzerland? Here’s how the two countries compare.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Quality-of-life-in-Germany-vs.-Switzerland>Quality of life in Germany vs. Switzerland</h2><p>The quality of life in Germany and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Switzerland</a> is excellent. Both countries tend to score well on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OECD’s Better Life Index</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, Switzerland has the edge over Germany in several areas, including safety, health, income and life satisfaction. In Germany, for example, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">76%</a> of people feel safe walking alone at night, compared to 86% of their Swiss counterparts. In terms of health, life expectancy in Switzerland is 84 years; in Germany, it’s slightly lower at 81.&nbsp;</p><p>Switzerland’s major cities also regularly make it onto lists of the most liveable cities in the world. Zurich and Geneva were in the top ten on the EIU’s Global Liveability Index 2023. However, the number one spot went to Vienna, giving Austria bragging rights over its German-speaking neighbors.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Cost-of-living-in-Germany-vs.-Switzerland>Cost of living in Germany vs. Switzerland</h2><p>While neither Germany nor Switzerland is a cheap place to live, the cost of living in Switzerland is significantly higher.&nbsp;</p><p>For the sake of comparison, let’s take <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berlin and Zurich</a>, the largest cities in Germany and Switzerland, respectively. Renting a one-bedroom apartment in Berlin’s city center costs an average of €1,266. The same apartment costs more than double that in Zurich (€2,600). A movie ticket in Berlin costs an average of €12.50, while it’s over €20 in Zurich. And if you want to use Switzerland’s famously efficient public transportation? A monthly ticket in Zurich costs €89 compared to Berlin’s €49 Deutschland-Ticket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On average, consumer prices are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">85% higher</a> in Switzerland than in Germany. However, comparing Switzerland and Germany in terms of salary turns this figure on its head. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Better Life Index</a>, the yearly salary averages $53,754 in Germany and $64,824 in Switzerland. The Swiss have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more disposable income</a> and greater purchasing power than the Germans on average. In other words, those who work in Switzerland can generally afford the higher prices.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Jobs-in-Germany-and-Switzerland>Jobs in Germany and Switzerland</h2><p>Speaking of work, which booming economy will you choose: Germany’s or Switzerland’s?&nbsp;</p><p>Both countries offer a wealth (no pun intended) of positions for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German</a> and non-German speakers alike. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Switzerland</a> is home to many international organizations as well as a buzzing financial sector. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a> is a technological powerhouse and has strong automotive and mechanical engineering industries.&nbsp;</p><p>Both countries have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high rates of employment</a> (77% in Germany and 80% in Switzerland) — evidence of a healthy labor market and good prospects for job seekers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Swiss-and-German-culture>Swiss and German culture</h2><p>Due to their close proximity, it should come as no surprise that Germany and Switzerland share many cultural aspects. Both countries have large German-speaking populations, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swiss German</a> differs significantly from the High German spoken in Germany.</p><p>Other linguistic differences exist, too. Switzerland has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four national languages</a> (German, French, Italian and Romansh) compared to Germany’s one official language (German). English is widely spoken in both nations. However, Germany ranks 11th in the world on English First’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English Proficiency Index 2022</a>, while Switzerland ranks 25th.&nbsp;</p><p>The food overall is pretty similar, though local dishes can be quite different. In Switzerland, cheese-based dishes like fondue and raclette are popular. German food, on the other hand, tends to go heavy on meat and potatoes (think Schnitzel with fries).&nbsp;</p><p>Major religious holidays like Christmas and Easter are widely celebrated in both countries. Citizens also celebrate national festivals, like Switzerland’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Day</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German Unity Day</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>People in both countries tend to lead active and outdoorsy lifestyles, enjoying diverse landscapes ranging from the forests of Germany to the mountains of Switzerland. The countries aren’t a uniform picture of health, though. Germany and Switzerland have relatively high rates of smoking among adults — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">26%</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">25%</a>, respectively, compared to just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">13%</a> in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Germany or Switzerland?</h2><p>Choosing whether to live in Germany or Switzerland boils down to personal preference. Both countries offer a high standard of living and share certain cultural features. Germany and Switzerland also have strong economies and offer expats a range of job opportunities. And while Switzerland is more expensive, the salaries there certainly make up for it. If you’re just visiting, why not go to both and see which you prefer? Just make sure you have a big budget if you’re visiting Switzerland!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
