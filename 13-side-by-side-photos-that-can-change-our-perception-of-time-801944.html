We&nbsp;also have a&nbsp;mind-blowing bonus waiting for you at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article.</p><p><h2>1. Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;and Marilyn Monroe would be&nbsp;the same age today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ca/3ed/8c07fa5594955e959d13db224d.jpg><p>The longest-reigning monarch in&nbsp;British history, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II</a>, and one of&nbsp;the most iconic actresses during the 1950s, <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>, were <strong>born just over a&nbsp;month apart</strong> in&nbsp;the year 1926. They were both 30&nbsp;years old when they <a href=#>met</a> each other at&nbsp;the 1956 film premiere of&nbsp;The Battle of&nbsp;the River Plate in&nbsp;London. At&nbsp;that time, Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;was only 4&nbsp;years into her reign, and Monroe was still at&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;her career.</p><p><h2>2. Woolly mammoths were still around when the pyramids were built.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f1/233/d8d7035b0dac5af9f8b9a47c34.jpg><p>We&nbsp;normally think of&nbsp;woolly mammoths as&nbsp;creatures that went extinct with the dinosaurs, but <strong>the prehistoric elephants were still roaming the earth when ancient Egyptians built the pyramids of&nbsp;Giza. </strong>The massive pyramid tombs were first <a href=#>constructed</a> about 4,500 years ago. In&nbsp;2019, a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;researchers published their <a href=#>findings</a> on&nbsp;mammoth fossils from Wrangel Island in&nbsp;the Arctic Ocean, which indicated that the last woolly mammoths died out in&nbsp;that area around 4,000 years ago.</p><p><h2>3. The University of&nbsp;Oxford is&nbsp;older than the Aztec Empire.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eca/4ba/d423b6521584047bdb2d8c9f2e.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Tenochtitlán</a>, or&nbsp;the capital of&nbsp;the Aztec Empire, was founded back in&nbsp;1325 in&nbsp;what is&nbsp;now known as&nbsp;Mexico City. But <strong>while the Aztecs were carving their <a href=#>sunstone</a>, scholars at&nbsp;Oxford were already discussing curriculums and doctrines</strong>. Teaching at&nbsp;the <a href=#>oldest</a> university (in&nbsp;the English-speaking world) began in&nbsp;the year 1096. By&nbsp;the thirteenth century, the university’s residence halls and first colleges were already established.</p><p><h2>4. Anne Frank and Martin Luther King&nbsp;Jr. were born the same year.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/873/b0b/eff3f053c4a9f3e214da8e4833.jpg><p>The diary of&nbsp;<a href=#>Anne Frank</a> and the legendary speeches of&nbsp;<a href=#>Martin Luther King</a>&nbsp;Jr. represent 2&nbsp;different periods in&nbsp;history&nbsp;— the Holocaust in&nbsp;Germany, and the height of&nbsp;the civil rights movement in&nbsp;America. However, <strong>b</strong><strong>oth historical icons were born in&nbsp;1929.</strong> King was <a href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;January 15&nbsp;of&nbsp;that year in&nbsp;Atlanta; while Frank was born 5&nbsp;months <a href=#>later</a> on&nbsp;June&nbsp;12, in&nbsp;Frankfurt.</p><p><h2>5. The Machu Picchu and the Sistine Chapel were built around the same time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be6/d5d/d20ba05b5399a95dfbd0407354.jpg><p>The architecture of&nbsp;these 2&nbsp;UNESCO World Heritage Sites bears a&nbsp;striking contrast. The <a href=#>Machu Picchu</a> in&nbsp;Peru is&nbsp;a&nbsp;citadel that was built using individually shaped stones, while the <a href=#>Sistine Chapel</a> in&nbsp;the Vatican City is&nbsp;decorated with Renaissance art. But <strong>these 2&nbsp;structures were built no&nbsp;more than 20-50 years apart.</strong></p><p>Recent radiocarbon dating <a href=#>estimated</a> the origins and existence of&nbsp;the Machu Picchu being between 1421 and 1476. Meanwhile, construction projects for the restoration of&nbsp;the Sistine Chapel started sometime between 1477 and 1480.</p><p><h2>6.

It&nbsp;wasn’t until 2007&nbsp;— 6&nbsp;years after Apple <a href=#>launched</a> its first generation of&nbsp;iPods&nbsp;— when <strong>criminal <a href=#>laws</a> were passed to&nbsp;prosecute slave owners.</strong></p><p><h2>7. Thomas Edison was still alive when the Empire State Building was opened.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eae/bff/93ae4d54b88bf4ec2c61b593aa.jpg><p><a href=#>Thomas Edison</a>, the inventor of&nbsp;the electric light bulb and many other great innovations, died on&nbsp;October&nbsp;18, 1931. But he&nbsp;was still alive when <strong>millions of&nbsp;his tiny inventions <a href=#>lit</a> up&nbsp;the newly constructed Empire State Building</strong> on&nbsp;May&nbsp;1, 1931. During the establishment’s opening ceremony, US&nbsp;President Herbert Hoover symbolically turned on&nbsp;the lights by&nbsp;pressing a&nbsp;button from the White House.</p><p><h2>8. We&nbsp;explored space before we&nbsp;understood earthquakes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7c/608/a1bf175f41ba0f3219ccfbf629.jpg><p><strong>Humans began exploring space way before the scientific community agreed on&nbsp;the theory that explains the movement in&nbsp;our planet’s crust.</strong> The idea that continents <a href=#>drifted</a> apart from one big lump of&nbsp;land was introduced as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;1912, but that concept was rejected for many years. It&nbsp;was only in&nbsp;1967 when the <a href=#>plate tectonics</a> theory, presented by&nbsp;Jason Morgan, was finally accepted and published. By&nbsp;then, a&nbsp;decade had already passed since the Soviet Union <a href=#>launched</a> the first artificial satellite in&nbsp;space, the Sputnik&nbsp;1.</p><p><h2>9.

Around that time, Mazzini and Garibaldi Giuseppe <a href=#>led</a> a&nbsp;small army around the Italian peninsula with the goal of&nbsp;conquering city-states and bringing them together under one ruler. In&nbsp;1861, the Kingdom of&nbsp;Italy was born.</p><p>Toward the end of&nbsp;World War&nbsp;II, the Italian monarchy fell and King Victor Emmanuel III formally <a href=#>abdicated</a>. In&nbsp;June of&nbsp;1946, Italy officially became a&nbsp;republic.</p><p><h2>10.

Can you imagine the hassle of&nbsp;living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world without cut-up loaves? Well, actress and comedian <a href=#>Betty White</a> can because <strong>sliced bread was only invented 6&nbsp;years after she was born.</strong> White was born on&nbsp;January&nbsp;17, 1922, while pre-cut bread was first <a href=#>sold</a> by&nbsp;a&nbsp;bakery in&nbsp;Chillicothe on&nbsp;July&nbsp;7, 1928.</p><p><h2>11.

It&nbsp;was the third time that mankind was able to&nbsp;set foot on&nbsp;the lunar surface. Meanwhile, back on&nbsp;Earth, “womankind” in&nbsp;Switzerland were also celebrating, as&nbsp;they were finally given the right to&nbsp;<a href=#>vote</a> on&nbsp;February&nbsp;7, 1971.</p><p><h2>12.

The prestigious university also didn’t have calculus as&nbsp;a&nbsp;subject when it&nbsp;started since Newton only <a href=#>invented</a> it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the mid to&nbsp;late 1660s.</p><p><h2>13.

The <a href=#>Apollo 11</a>&nbsp;mission successfully landed on&nbsp;the moon on&nbsp;July&nbsp;20, 1969, allowing Neil Armstrong to&nbsp;take that one giant leap for mankind.</p><p><h2>BONUS: Cleopatra lived closer to&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the golden arch than the pyramids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78c/d9b/6ec8c6536b8b681accb743d33a.jpg><p>It&nbsp;sounds strange, but Egyptian queen, <a href=# title=Cleopatra data-link=tag>Cleopatra</a> lived closer to&nbsp;the establishment of&nbsp;the first McDonald’s than the construction of&nbsp;the pyramids<strong>.</strong> Historians estimate her birth <a href=#>year</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;either 70&nbsp;or 69&nbsp;B.C.E, which is&nbsp;about 2,400 to&nbsp;2,500 years after the pyramids were <a href=#>built</a>.
