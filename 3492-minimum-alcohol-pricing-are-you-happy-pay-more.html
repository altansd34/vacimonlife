Participants debate the pros and cons of setting a minimum unit price for alcohol</b></p><p>Across the UK, the question of whether or not a minimum price for a unit of alcohol should be introduced has continued to arise in recent months.<b></b></p><p>Previously, <a href=#>an independent study by Sheffield University</a> – commissioned by the Department of Health in 2008 – had concluded that a minimum alcohol unit price set at 45p would help reduce the amount of alcohol drunk by ‘hazardous and harmful drinkers’.</p><p>In Scotland, the Alcohol Minimum Pricing Bill is currently making its second passage through parliament. Once passed, it will set the minimum unit price at 50p, instead of the 45p previously endorsed, making the ­cheapest bottle of wine £4.69, while a four-pack of lager would cost at least £3.52.</p><p>The Scottish Government hopes that this will lead to a reduction in hospital admissions, violence and deaths through alcohol abuse.</p><p><b>David Cameron is also talking about introducing a 40p per unit price in England and Wales.</b></p><p>The drinks industry has argued that raising the price of alcohol will disproportionately affect responsible consumers, and is not an effective solution for addressing alcohol-related problems. <a href=#>The price of alcohol has actually risen at a faster rate than many other goods over the last 25 years</a>, yet people are consuming more than ever.</p><p><b href=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/03/30/minimum-price-alcohol/ target=_blank><a href=#>YouGov's Public Opinion polling</a> in March this year</b><b> found that the UK public were split evenly over the issue – with 46% in support of the minimum pricing, and 46% agains</b>t.</p><p>And responses were similarly divided when we invited you into Labs to argue your case for or against setting a minimum unit price for alcohol.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/PA-bus-stop_form.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>However, those of with you with opinions on the matter, who were in favour of minimum pricing, were then split over exactly what price the minimum should be set at.</strong></p><p>Those of you who took part and were against the minimum price laws thought it was unfair to expect everyone to pay the price for a policy aimed at tackling a minority of people for whom alcohol is a problem.</p><p>They suggested that the introduction of such a baseline might not solve the bigger problems, and that it should not be up to the Government to set alcohol prices.</p><p>Participants in favour of minimum price laws mainly thought the price should be higher – to really make a point.</p><p>Those who thought 45p was about right explained that, in their eyes, action needed to be taken, and this seems like a good starting place. Just a few participants thought that 45p was too high a minimum price.</p><h2><img alt height=3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2011-11-09/LabsLine.png width=620 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2><b><i>What are your thoughts on introducing a law for a minimum alcohol unit price?
