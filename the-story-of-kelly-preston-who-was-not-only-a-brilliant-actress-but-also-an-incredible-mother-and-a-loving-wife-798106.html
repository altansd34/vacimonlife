She passed away on&nbsp;<a href=#>July 12</a>&nbsp;and the whole world is&nbsp;grieving with her family.</p><p><strong>Bright Sight</strong> is&nbsp;deeply mourning the Travolta family’s loss and would like to&nbsp;share some facts about Kelly Preston in&nbsp;her memory.</p><p><h2>1. Her childhood wasn’t easy but she made it&nbsp;through.</h2></p><p>Kelly’s father passed away when she was just <a href=#>3</a>&nbsp;years old due to&nbsp;drowning. Her mother Linda, who ran a&nbsp;mental health institution, remarried. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, she lived in&nbsp;<a href=#>Iraq</a> and <a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a> where she managed to&nbsp;study drama and theatre and chase her dreams.</p><h2>2. She appeared in&nbsp;<a href=#>72</a>&nbsp;movies and shows.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff1/d75/0d65385bd98e7e7fdaf4dc2ce9.jpg><p>Kelly always had a&nbsp;flair for acting and was discovered at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;16. She started off working in&nbsp;commercials and her first big breakthrough came with the 1985 romantic comedy flick, <a href=#>Mischief</a>. Following that, she scored roles in&nbsp;<a href=#>Secret Admirer</a>, <a href=#>Twins</a>, <a href=#>Jerry Maguire</a>, and worked alongside prominent actors like <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito, Jeff Goldblum, and John Travolta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/573/ac9/ad543750f0bd2c712ec192b240.jpg><p>Kelly and John first met on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> in&nbsp;<a href=#>1987</a>. Their eyes met but she was already married to&nbsp;Kevin Gage. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Kelly <a href=#>revealed</a> that she was not happily married and the couple eventually divorced the same year. John and Kelly tied the knot in&nbsp;1991.</p><p><h2>4. She believed in&nbsp;spoiling her kids with love.</h2></p><p>The <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> power couple had 3&nbsp;children together: Jett, Ella, and Benjamin.

She lost her eldest son when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;16.</h2></p><p>John and Kelly were faced with the greatest tragedy of&nbsp;their lives when their eldest son passed away after suffering a&nbsp;seizure due to&nbsp;<a href=#>Kawasaki</a> disease. The pain of&nbsp;the loss was so&nbsp;incredible that the family started to&nbsp;fall apart until Benjamin was born. “He’s given the house a&nbsp;renewed spirit and purpose. He’s brought&nbsp;us a&nbsp;new beginning, and his presence has brought joy to&nbsp;all.” John <a href=#>said</a>, speaking of&nbsp;his newborn son.</p><p><h2>6. Through ups and downs, John Travolta and Kelly were married for 29&nbsp;years.</h2></p><p>Coping with their son’s death was not easy for the couple and it&nbsp;was especially hard on&nbsp;their marriage. To&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;it, they both agreed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>counseling</a> and give each other some space. “We&nbsp;really care deeply about each other and we&nbsp;protect each other and we&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;to&nbsp;date,” John revealed as&nbsp;he&nbsp;explained the <a href=#>secret</a> to&nbsp;the couple’s happy and successful marriage that lasted almost 3&nbsp;decades.

According to&nbsp;her daughter, there’s no&nbsp;one as&nbsp;courageous or&nbsp;loving as&nbsp;her mom.</h2></p><p>Ella Travolta has never held back when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;praising her mom, be&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;her birthday or&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Mother’s Day</a>. Announcing her mom’s demise, the 20-year-old shared a&nbsp;heartfelt post on&nbsp;her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, thanking Kelly for always being there for her and for her unconditional love.
