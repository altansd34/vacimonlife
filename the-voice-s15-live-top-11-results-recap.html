This means that we will have a bottom two competing for tonight’s Instant Save. And all but one artist will earn a spot to perform again next week! We also have performances to look forward to from Blake and his team, Jennifer and her team, and <a href=#>“The Comeback Stage”</a> fifth coach, <a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini</a>!</strong></p><p>So let’s see who earned America’s votes and will advance to the Top 10!</p><h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-27-at-8.39.11-PM.png alt=TheVoice-Top11Elims width=728 height=481 sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><h3>The Results Are In!</h3><p>Throughout the night, the results from last night’s Top 11 voting were revealed. First, Kennedy Holmes and Kymberli Joye were both announced as safe. No surprises here! Both had standout performances last night. Later, we had <a href=#>Reagan Strange</a> and Chris Kroeze advance to the Top 10. Also not too surprising. But I was surprised to hear that Reagan earned the Apple Music streaming bonus again this week! Next to be saved by America’s votes were <a href=#>Kirk Jay</a> and MaKenzie Thomas. Again, more of the shoe-ins to make it through. Last to be called safe were Sarah Grace, <a href=#>Dave Fenley</a>, and <a href=#>Chevel Shepherd</a>. Now with all those artists being announced, this was the shock to me. Lynnea Moorer makes sense because she was in the bottom two last week but DeAndre Nico? All I’m saying is #notmybottomtwo!</p><p>Now, we’ll go over the performances that were mixed in with these results, then go through to the Instant Save!</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo1FTiAnfCc</a></p><h3>Team Blake Performs “Dixieland Delight”</h3><p>Blake Shelton, along with his artists Dave Fenley, Kirk Jay, and Chris Kroeze, sang “Dixieland Delight” by Alabama. This song catered well to all of their voices but I wish they did something more upbeat! They were all rocking out on guitar for sure. I just think it was too tame knowing all of their personalities. This is a fun bunch of country guys! I wish we could’ve seen more of that. But we may get another performance with all of them, since they’ll all still be around next week for the Top 10!</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prjQADuvUAs</a></p><h3>Kelsea Ballerini Performs “Miss Me More”</h3><p>Kelsea came on to sing her new hit single, “Miss Me More.” This is the same song she performed at the CMA Awards last week and got some slack for not being country enough. But it was a perfect song for The Voice stage! She looked great and sang well, making a fun performance to watch. Kelsea has been a great addition to The Voice family!</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbJhfQ5ZRFI</a></p><h3>Team JHud Performs “The Rose”</h3><p>Jennifer and her remaining artists, Kennedy Holmes and MaKenzie Thomas, sang “The Rose” by Bette Midler. This was an epic performance. As much as I give Kennedy a hard time for doing pageant songs, she, JHud, and MaKenzie absolutely killed this. Their harmonies were insane and they each had a chance to shine. This is the kind of team performances we want to see! Shoes should have been thrown.</p><h3>Instant Save Performances</h3><p>The bottom two artists this week were Lynnea Moorer and DeAndre Nico. Both had the chance to sing for their lives tonight!</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTHUDUNaoY0</a></p><p>Up first was Team Kelly’s Lynnea Moorer. Lynnea being in this position is not a surprise. The deck has been stacked against her, with her rising up on “The Comeback Stage” and only joining Kelly’s team two weeks ago. But she has been back with a vengeance! Lynnea chose to sing “Tattooed Heart” by Ariana Grande for her Instant Save performance. This was not her best song choice or performance. I think we’ve seen a lot better from her and the fact that she’s first up is not helping her case.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMquuVbWmmo</a></p><p>Next was Team Adam’s DeAndre Nico. After giving us a slow jam last night, DeAndre stuck to the emotional songs he’s best at when he sang “Take Me to the King” by Tamela Mann. He honestly killed this performance. Like Adam, I was surprised that he is even being considered to go home. DeAndre doesn’t deserve this. And he proved that with his performance here.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=523MYwKaJPk</a></p><p>It was very clear from the initial results where this was going. And I think the bottom two knew that too. When the Instant Save window ended, Carson announced that the winner was…DeAndre Nico! That means Lynnea Moorer was eliminated this week.</p><h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TheVoice-Top10.png alt=TheVoice-Top10 width=789 height=517 sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><h3>The Top 10</h3><p>So with DeAndre Nico earning the last spot in the Instant Save, we have this season’s Top 10! On Team Adam, we have DeAndre Nico and Reagan Strange. Team Kelly has Chevel Shepherd, Kymberli Joye, and Sarah Grace. JHud still has Kennedy Holmes and MaKenzie Thomas on her team. And Team Blake is strong with Dave Fenley, Kirk Jay, and Chris Kroeze.</p><p>Tune in to The Voice next Monday as they all perform to advance to the Semifinals.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/katy-perry-josh-kloss-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Katy Perry and Gwen Stefani to Perform in Wildfire Benefit Concert" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedJqbGakmauybsDOqWRqaV2nsrTBy62qZqqVmK6xew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1541564-rare-boy-protects-sleeping-mother-falling-couch-video-viral-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;Rare to See&amp;quot;: Little Boy Protects His Sleeping Mother from Falling from the Couch, Video Goes Viral</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./40810-italian-food-crimes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Youre doing Italian food all wrong, say Italians</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1599691-olanrewaju-kayodes-wife-bombshell-revelations-viral-interview-ks-mum-a-witch.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./americas-got-talent-prize-has-been-changed-whats-new.html>'Americas Got Talent' Prize Has Been Changed Whats New?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-voice-rivals-kique-gomez-parijita-bastola-spark-dating-rumors.html>'The Voice' Rivals Kique Gomez, Parijita Bastola Spark Dating Rumors</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-women-who-said-goodbye-to-razors-and-couldnt-be-happier-813022.html>15 Women Who Said Goodbye to Razors and Couldnt Be Happier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1150975-most-touching-love-messages-boyfriend-html.html>150+ most touching love messages for boyfriend he will adore</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/celeb/>Celeb</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
