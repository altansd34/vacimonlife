Kim and Ray J made a sex tape while they were still together.</p><p class=align-left>The former Ray J wife Kardashian was furious at the revelation, which led to sueing of Vivid Entertainment for holding the video. However, Kardashian lowered the suit and resolved with the firm paying <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$300,000</a> for each tape as well as a cut from the videos sold or downloaded. Unfortunately, the Ray J Kim love story ended after the scandal.
