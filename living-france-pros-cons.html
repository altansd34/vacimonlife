While the country does have a lot to offer, as with anywhere, it’s not all sunshine and roses. It’s important to research a country before you move there, so you know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which city is best for you</a>, what paperwork you need and how to get <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">properly set up</a>. We’ve put together a list of six pros and cons of living in France to help you get a better understanding of what it’s like. Let’s dive right in.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Pros of living in France</a></p><li><a href=#>Quality of life</a></li><li><a href=#>Work-life balance</a></li><li><a href=#>Healthcare</a></li><p id=Cons-of-living-in-France><a href=#>Cons of living in France</a></p><li><a href=#>Bureaucracy</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=#>Tax</a></li><li><a href=#>Cost of living</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Pros-of-Living-in-France>Pros of Living in France</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Quality-of-life>1. Quality of life</h2><p>The number one pro of living in France is, without a doubt, the quality of life. The country <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly appears</a> in the list of the top countries for this category. This is for a number of reasons: Fresh produce is grown locally; French cuisine is renowned around the world; the country offers a variety of landscapes; spending time outdoors in nature is very common and easy to do; residents enjoy a slower pace of life making work-life balance more than achievable; university education is cheap and the healthcare system is outstanding. These are but a few of the many reasons why the quality of life in France is consistently ranked as one of the best in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Work-life-balance>2. Work-life balance</h2><p>In general, the work-life balance in France is more achievable than in other countries – especially the United States. The two-hour lunch break truly is part and parcel for most jobs in France. The standard working week is 35 hours and the country has 11 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public holidays</a>. On Sundays, most stores and supermarkets are closed, giving everyone the opportunity for rest. And to round it all off, the country essentially closes down during the month of August so everyone can enjoy a long holiday and spend time with their kids. Fun fact: Children get two-week holidays every 6-7 weeks, plus two months off in summer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Healthcare>3. Healthcare</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">healthcare system</a> is yet another aspect of life in France that’s considered one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best in the world</a>. The state offers coverage for everyone regardless of income, with residents having to pay only a small part (usually 25% maximum). If they then add on a mutuelle (insurance), they should be covered 100%. This not only includes standard doctor’s visits but also prescriptions, hospital stays, emergencies and pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cons of living in France</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Bureaucracy>1. Bureaucracy</h2><p>France has long been associated with red tape and unfortunately, it is a stereotype that holds true. Everything from opening a bank account and setting up visas to grappling with the tax system can be complex and slow. Answers provided by government officials can vary depending on who you speak to. And the system in general is not as organized as it is in other countries like the States. Even the simplest of tasks, such as changing address, can very quickly become a headache.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Tax>2. Tax</h2><p>Yet another category where France is regularly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top of the list </a>is tax. It has one of the highest tax systems in the world, with the top band hitting a whopping 45%. And that’s just income tax! You also have to add tax on goods and services, social security tax and even a TV tax. However, a good percentage of tax in the country goes towards providing many of the elements in the pros list above (e.g. healthcare) so it’s really a trade-off that’s worth it in the long run.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Cost-of-living>3. Cost of living</h2><p>While France has so much to offer residents, it does come at a price. Aside from the high taxes, the cost of living in the country is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the highest in Europe</a>. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris</a>, accommodation is extortionately expensive and daily living costs from food to transport are high. Outside of the capital, the cost of living varies. In the countryside, life in France is much cheaper but you often need a car to get around which pushes costs back up. Cities in the south are consistently ranked as expensive and even traveling around from region to region is costly, due to the toll system on the roads.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>It’s all worth it&nbsp;</h2><p>Every country has pros and cons but there’s a reason why so many people dream of moving to and living in France. The pros far outweigh the cons and living in the country can truly offer you a wonderful lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Clara-1-2.jpeg><h2>Clara Avrillier</h2><p>Clara Avrillier is a writer, linguist and content manager living in the South of France.
